<h1><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_5'></a>5</span>The Motor Maids by Palm and Pine</h1>
<h2><a name='chI' id='chI'></a>CHAPTER I.—TO THE SUNNY SOUTH.</h2>
<p>
The Atlantic Ocean and the breadth of
Europe including half of Russia lay between
Mr. Duncan Campbell and his daughter, Wilhelmina.
But that did not prevent Mr. Campbell
from thinking of numerous delightful surprises
for Billie and her three friends in West
Haven.
</p>
<p>
Sometimes it was a mere scrawl of a note
hastily written at some small way station, saying:
“Here’s a check for my Billie-girl. Treat
your friends to ice-cream sodas and take ’em to
the theater. Don’t forget your old Dad.”
</p>
<p>
Sometimes the surprise took the form of queer
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_6'></a>6</span>
foreign-looking packages addressed to “the
Misses Campbell, Butler, Brown and Price,” containing
strange articles made by the peasants in
the far-away land. He sent them each a Cossack
costume with high red boots and red sashes.
But some three weeks before the Easter holidays
came the best surprise of all.
</p>
<p>
“I believe the Comet needs a change of air,”
wrote Mr. Campbell. “A fine automobile must
have as careful handling as a thoroughbred
horse, or, for that matter, a thoroughbred young
lady. What does my Billie-girl say to an Easter
trip to Florida with Cousin Helen as guardian
angel and Nan and Nell and Moll for company
and the Comet for just his own sweet self?”
</p>
<p>
Mr. Campbell, who received long, intimate letters
from his daughter once a week, felt that he
knew the girls almost as well as she did, and he
would call them by abbreviated, pet names in
spite of Billie’s remonstrances.
</p>
<p>
“It so happens,” the letter continued, “that my
old friend, Ignatius Donahue, who holds the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_7'></a>7</span>
small, unimportant, poorly-paid position of vice-president
of an insignificant railroad, not knowing
that I was digging trenches in Russia, has
offered me the use of his private car, including
kitchen stove, chef and other necessities. I have
answered that I accept the invitation, not for
self, but for daughter and friends and Comet;
which latter must have free transportation on
first-class fast-going freight, or he is no friend
of mine. You will be hearing from Ignatius now
pretty soon. Your old dad will be answerable for
all other expenses, including hotel and-so-forth
and if the and-so-forth is bigger than the hotel
bill, he’ll never even chirp. Life is short and
time is fleeting and young girls must go South
in the winter when they have a chance.”
</p>
<p>
So, that is how the Motor Maids happened to
be the four busiest young women in West Haven—what
with those abominable High School examinations
which always came about this time,
and the getting together of a Palm Beach wardrobe.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8'></a>8</span>
</p>
<p>
And that is also how, one cold wet day at the
end of March, they found themselves lolling in
big comfortable chairs in Mr. Donahue’s private
car while the train whizzed southward.
</p>
<p>
It had been a bustle and a rush at the last
moment and they were glad to leave West
Haven, which was a dreary, misty little place at
that time of the year.
</p>
<p>
Miss Campbell leaned back in her wicker chair
and regarded her four charges proudly. How
neat they looked in their pretty traveling suits
and new spring hats!
</p>
<p>
“I am so glad they are young girls and not
young ladies,” she was thinking, when her meditations
were interrupted by Sam, the colored
chef and porter combined, whose arms were
laden with packages.
</p>
<p>
“Why, what are you bringing us, Sam?” asked
the little lady with some curiosity.
</p>
<p>
“With Mr. Donahue’s compliments, ma’am,
and he hopes the ladies won’t git hungry and
bored on the journey,” replied Sam, depositing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9'></a>9</span>
the packages on a chair and drawing it up within
Miss Campbell’s reach.
</p>
<p>
“Dear me, children,” she exclaimed excitedly,
“look what this nice man has sent us. I feel
like a girl again myself. A beautiful bunch of
violets apiece——”
</p>
<p>
“And a big box of candy,” exclaimed Nancy
Brown.
</p>
<p>
“And all the latest magazines,” added Billie
Campbell, laughing.
</p>
<p>
“What a dear he is,” finished Elinor Butler,
fastening on her violets with a long lavender pin;
while Mary Price gave her own violets a passionate
little squeeze.
</p>
<p>
“I hopes,” went on Sam, shifting from one
foot to the other, “I hopes the ladies ain’t goin’
to eat so much candy they won’t have no appetite
for they dinner. We g’wine have spring chicken
to-night, an’ fresh green peas an’ new asparagrass,
an’ strawbe’ies. I’d be mighty sorry if
de ladies don’ leave no space for my dinner.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10'></a>10</span>
Marse Donahue he don’ kill de fatted ca’f fo’ dis
here ’casion.”
</p>
<p>
“Sam, we’ll close the candy box this minute,”
said Miss Campbell. “And you needn’t bring
us any tea this afternoon. You need feel no uneasiness
about your spring chickens and your
new peas. I shall write to Mr. Donahue myself
as soon as I get to Palm Beach and thank him
for his kindness.”
</p>
<p>
“He’s a very nice gemman, he is that,” observed
Sam.
</p>
<p>
“Is he a young man, Sam?” asked Nancy,
with young girl curiosity.
</p>
<p>
“He ain’t to say young or old, Missy. He don’
took his stan’ on the dividin’ line an’ thar he
stan’.”
</p>
<p>
“How long has he been standing there, Sam?”
put in Elinor.
</p>
<p>
“I knowed the gemman twenty years an’ he
ain’t never stepped off yit.”
</p>
<p>
The private car rang with their cheerful
laughter.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11'></a>11</span>
</p>
<p>
“He must be a wonderful man,” said Miss
Campbell. “I wish he would teach me his
secret.”
</p>
<p>
“His secret is, ma’am, he ain’t never got married
and had no fambly troubles to age his countenance,”
answered Sam.
</p>
<p>
“But,” cried Miss Campbell, “I’ve never been
married either, and I’m white-haired and infirm.”
</p>
<p>
“You infirm, ma’am! You de youngest one in
de lot,” answered the colored man, turning his
frankly admiring gaze on the pretty little lady
as he backed down the car, grinning, and disappeared
in his own quarters.
</p>
<p>
“You see, Cousin,” said Billie, patting Miss
Campbell’s cheek, “you must never try to make
people believe again that you are old. You are
a pretty young lady gone gray before her time.”
</p>
<p>
It was plain that Mr. Ignatius Donahue was
very much pleased with the arrangements he
had made with his old friend, Duncan Campbell.
All along the journey he had fresh surprises for his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12'></a>12</span>
five guests. At one place came a
big basket of fruit; at another station a colored
woman climbed on the train and presented each
of them with a splendid magnolia in full bloom,
that filled the car with its fragrance.
</p>
<p>
“With Mr. Donahue’s compliments, ma’am;
an’ he says he hopes the ladies is enjoyin’ they
selves,” she added as she gave Miss Campbell the
largest blossom in the bunch.
</p>
<p>
“Dear, dear,” cried Miss Campbell. “One
would think Mr. Donahue were taking this journey
with us. He is so attentive. Is he anywhere
around here?”
</p>
<p>
“No, ma’am,” interrupted Sam, with a warning
look at the colored woman. “Marse Donahue,
he jes’ give orders and specs ’em to be kerried
out like he says.”
</p>
<p>
“I feel as if Mr. Donahue were a sort of spirit
always hovering near us,” said Billie, when the
two colored people had disappeared, “a kind of
guardian angel. I wish papa had told us something
about him.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13'></a>13</span>
</p>
<p>
“A very substantial spirit,” observed Miss
Campbell, “showering upon us all these gifts of
fruits and flowers and candy.”
</p>
<p>
“What does Mr. Donahue look like, Sam,”
Nancy asked the colored man later. “Is he tall
and thin?”
</p>
<p>
“No, ma’am; he ain’t what you might call
tall. An’ he ain’t short neither.
</p>
<p>
“Medium, then?”
</p>
<p>
“Not jes’ exactly mejum, neither, ma’am.”
</p>
<p>
“Go way, Sam. You don’t know what he is.
I don’t believe you ever saw Mr. Donahue.”
</p>
<p>
“Ain’t I don’ tol’ you I knowed Marse Donahue
twenty years? But I couldn’t paint no picture
of him, Missy.”
</p>
<p>
“What color is his hair, Sam?” asked Mary.
</p>
<p>
“It ain’t white an’ it ain’t black, neither,
Missy.”
</p>
<p>
Miss Campbell herself joined in the laughter
which Sam’s reply raised and they asked no more
questions about Mr. Donahue’s appearance. But
the magnolias were not the last token from their
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14'></a>14</span>
mysterious host, who seemed to have arranged
everything with the greatest care and forethought.
When the train stopped at the Palm
Beach station, there was the Comet waiting for
them like a faithful steed. The red motor had
been shipped nearly a week before, and the sight
of his cheerful face was like meeting an old
friend.
</p>
<p>
“Sam, you just give Mr. Donahue <em>my</em> compliments,”
exclaimed Billie, patting the Comet
affectionately, “and tell him that next to my
father he’s the nicest man I ever knew, or rather
didn’t know, because I haven’t met him yet.”
</p>
<p>
Sam bowed and scraped and grinned in the
familiar manner of his race as he helped the
ladies into the car. A young chauffeur was at
the wheel, and Billie and Nancy crowded into
the front seat beside him while the others sat
in the back as usual. For a long time the train
had been passing through a flat country, monotonous
with palm trees and undergrowth, and
now they seemed to have broken into fairyland.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15'></a>15</span>
The air was laden with the scent of flowers and
the sound of music floated to them in the stillness.
</p>
<p>
“The concert in Cocoanut Grove,” explained
the chauffeur to Nancy and Billie.
</p>
<p>
“Are we in heaven?” asked Mary Price,
dreamily.
</p>
<p>
“It will be three weeks of heaven, I hope, my
child,” answered Miss Campbell, patting the
young girl’s hand.
</p>
<p>
Those of you who have read the first volume
of this series will recall how Mary Price had
been made the victim of a cruel conspiracy a few
months before, during which only the faith of
her friends and a strange combination of circumstances
prevented her from being branded
as a thief. The unhappiness and anxiety which
she had endured during that trying time, followed
by months of hard study, had sapped her
strength, and Mary more than any of the Motor
Maids needed this change to a southern climate.
</p>
<p>
“This is Lake Worth,” observed the chauffeur,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16'></a>16</span>
pointing to a beautiful placid body of water, the
little waves of which lapped the shores so softly
that the whir of the motor engine seemed out
of place in that quiet spot.
</p>
<p>
For the first time, the girls noticed the chauffeur.
He seemed very young to be running a
machine; although Billie did not reflect that she
herself was not much past the sixteenth goal;
but then she ran her own machine, and he was
a public chauffeur. He was a handsome boy
with black hair and blue eyes and he spoke with
a soft, beautiful accent.
</p>
<p>
Billie was about to ask him a question, when
they drew up in front of the great hotel where
their rooms had been engaged for days in advance.
</p>
<p>
A curious thing happened in connection with
their chauffeur while the Motor Maids and Miss
Campbell stood in a group at the hotel desk waiting
for the busy clerk to give them his attention.
The boy had gallantly helped them out of
the car, carried in their suitcases and satchels
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17'></a>17</span>
and placed them in a pile, and Miss Campbell
had extended her hand with the usual tip, when
a muscular-looking man with smooth face and
burnsides, touched the chauffeur respectfully
on the shoulder.
</p>
<p>
“I beg your pardon, Mr. Edward,” he said in
a low voice, “your grandmother is waiting to
see you.”
</p>
<p>
“My grandmother waiting to see me?” repeated
the chauffeur with amazement.
</p>
<p>
The English servant, for that was evidently
what he was, gave him a long and searching
look and stepped backward with a puzzled expression
on his face.
</p>
<p>
“You’ve made a mistake, I reckon,” said the
boy, smiling gently.
</p>
<p>
“Beg pardon, sir,” replied the man and moved
quickly away.
</p>
<p>
Miss Campbell, who liked the looks of Edward,
as he by a curious coincidence happened also to
be named, and was taken with his quiet, respectful
manners, engaged him on the spot to be their
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18'></a>18</span>
chauffeur and guide, since they were unfamiliar
with the roads.
</p>
<p>
“I can run a motor-boat, too, ma’am,” he said.
</p>
<p>
And that was another reason for taking him
into their service; for they had planned to take
many a sail on the placid waters of Lake Worth
and to picnic along those verdant shores.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19'></a>19</span><a name='chII' id='chII'></a>CHAPTER II.—MAKING NEW ACQUAINTANCES.</h2>
<p>
“Mr. Ignatius Donahue’s compliments, and
will the ladies take a ride in his motor-boat this
afternoon? Mr. Donahue is sorry he cannot go
too, but a business engagement prevents his being
at Palm Beach.”
</p>
<p>
This was the message brought to Miss Campbell
the morning after their arrival at Palm
Beach. The bearer of the message was Edward,
the young chauffeur, who stood at a respectful
distance while she read the note.
</p>
<p>
“But if Mr. Donahue isn’t here, how did the
note come?” asked Miss Campbell, much mystified.
</p>
<p>
“I can’t say, ma’am,” replied Edward, turning
his face away so that they could not see the
smile which twitched the corners of his mouth.
</p>
<p>
“Perhaps he telegraphed it,” observed Billie.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20'></a>20</span>
</p>
<p>
“But it’s written on note paper,” replied Miss
Campbell, rather irritably. “Would you like to
go, girls?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, yes,” chorused the four voices.
</p>
<p>
“Very well, Edward, there seems no one to tell
it to but you. We shall accept the invitation with
pleasure. It would be absurd, I suppose, to telegraph
this important communication to Mr. Donahue
at Kamschatka or Boston or wherever he
is, but he is very kind to offer us his boat and
you may expect us on the pier this afternoon at
four. Is that a good time for sailing?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, ma’am,” replied Edward, withdrawing
down the corridor just as the door of an adjoining
room opened and an angry voice cried:
</p>
<p>
“How dare you meddle with anything in this
room? Leave it instantly.”
</p>
<p>
Some one replied in a low musical voice,
</p>
<p>
“I am very sorry. I was only looking at a
picture. I noticed a likeness——”
</p>
<p>
“You are here to clean up and not to notice.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21'></a>21</span>
You are a servant and not a visitor. Another
time and you will be reported. You may go.”
</p>
<p>
At this point a girl was thrust out into the hall
so roughly that she fell on her knees. It was
only a chambermaid, and perhaps she was accustomed
to being spoken to harshly, although
she did not appear to be, for she covered her
face with her hands and crouched against the
wall.
</p>
<p>
“How could any one be so brutal?” exclaimed
Billie indignantly as she ran to the trembling little
figure and helped her to her feet. “Won’t
you come into our room until you calm down?
It was cruel to have spoken to you so roughly.”
</p>
<p>
The door opened again and an old woman
stood on the threshold, leaning on a cane. There
was something rather regal in her appearance,
in spite of her plain black dress and grotesque-looking
old garden hat with its flapping brim
which half concealed her face.
</p>
<p>
“Don’t interfere, young woman,” said the formidable-looking
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22'></a>22</span>
personage. “Young American
girls are far too impertinent.”
</p>
<p>
Billie, who all her life had been the champion
of the oppressed, was not frightened by the glare
from the old woman’s steely blue eyes. She
made no reply, however. Her father had taught
her never to engage in a battle of words if she
could possibly avoid it, especially with an older
person.
</p>
<p>
Putting her arm around the little chambermaid’s
waist, she drew her into Miss Campbell’s
room and closed the door. The other girls who
had been silent witnesses of the scene gathered
around them.
</p>
<p>
“What a dreadful old person,” Billie burst out
at last, giving vent to her indignant feelings,
when the girl staggered and almost fell on the
floor.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, the poor dear is fainting,” cried Miss
Campbell, hurrying to the dressing-table for her
smelling salts, while the others quickly lifted the
little maid to the bed. They opened her dress
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23'></a>23</span>
at the throat and moistened her lips with water
and performed the numberless little services a
woman, with any kindly sympathy in her nature,
will never withhold from another woman who
needs her help.
</p>
<p>
“She is much too young and pretty to be a
servant,” observed Miss Campbell, looking down
with pity into the white, tired face of the chambermaid,
who appeared hardly older than her
own girls, although her fluffy blond hair was
drawn up into a knot on top of her head. Presently
the color came back to her face, and she
opened her eyes which were large and very deep
blue.
</p>
<p>
“Are you better now?” asked Billie, waving a
palm-leaf fan gently over her head.
</p>
<p>
The girl sat up and looked about her in bewilderment.
</p>
<p>
“Where am I?” she asked. Then her eyes
caught Billie’s kind gray ones and memory came
back to her. “It was so good of you to take my
part and so stupid of me to faint! I was frightened,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24'></a>24</span>
I suppose, and a little tired. I must be
going, now,” she looked toward the door uneasily.
“It would be dreadful to lose my place on
the first day I began to work.”
</p>
<p>
“But you are not going back to work when you
are ill, child?” exclaimed Miss Campbell.
</p>
<p>
“I’m afraid I must. It will be only a few
hours more. I am off at twelve. My work isn’t
hard. I only sort and distribute the fresh linen,”
she added with a note of apology in her voice,
which was soft and beautiful. The girls were
struck also with her lady-like manner. They
could see that she was not accustomed to being
a maid because she never said, “Yes, Miss,” and
“No, Miss,” like the usual chambermaid. But
they were too polite to ask any questions, and
presently she withdrew without their knowing
much more about her than they had at first.
</p>
<p>
But they soon forgot the chambermaid and
her troubles in the joys of Palm Beach. Probably
nobody in the world can have a better time
than four intimate young friends on a pleasure
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25'></a>25</span>
trip, and many admiring glances were turned in
the direction of the Motor Maids as they sat in
a row on the hotel veranda after breakfast, while
Miss Campbell composed a letter in the writing-room.
They were entirely unconscious of the
attention they attracted, however, so interested
were they in watching the rippling waters of
Lake Worth already dotted with white sails.
</p>
<p>
Groups of people, dressed in white, strolled
about the hotel grounds or sat on garden seats
under the palm trees. It was that delicious lazy
time in the morning when one is on a holiday and
there is only pleasure to anticipate.
</p>
<p>
“Billie,” whispered Nancy, “there is that
brutal old woman who was so rude to the chambermaid
this morning. I honestly believe she
would have struck you with her stick if you had
answered a word.”
</p>
<p>
“If she had,” replied Billie, laughing, “and I
had cabled it to Papa, he would have taken a
flying leap across the Atlantic Ocean and got
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26'></a>26</span>
here before midnight. But I really don’t think
she would have dared go that far.”
</p>
<p>
“Be careful, here she is upon us,” warned
Elinor, and the four girls, without intending to
be rude, turned their eyes toward the approaching
figure.
</p>
<p>
The old woman still wore her flapping garden
hat tied under the chin with brown silk strings.
She leaned on her cane heavily as she walked,
and noticed no one until she saw the four pairs
of eyes regarding her with evident curiosity.
</p>
<p>
She paused in front of the group and brandished
her stick in their faces.
</p>
<p>
“Well, what do you think you are looking at,”
she cried, “a chimpanzee or an elephant or one
of your own native wild people?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, grandmamma,” cried a tall, slender girl
walking at her side. “How can you talk in that
way? You mortify me terribly.” And she led
the old woman into the hall.
</p>
<p>
“What a fierce old party,” exclaimed a young
man in white flannels, who was sitting so low
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27'></a>27</span>
in a deep chair that he appeared all legs and
arms. “‘Native wild people,’” he repeated,
laughing gaily. “We look like native wild people
in this civilized place, don’t we?”
</p>
<p>
“Now, Timothy,” said a girl sitting next to
him, “she meant you, I am sure. You resemble
a native wild person more than any one here,
with your absurd bristling red hair.”
</p>
<p>
The young man laughed good-naturedly, and
the girls could not resist joining in, for Timothy
might have been taken for a human porcupine
any day. And that was how the Motor Maids
came to make friends with Timothy Peppercorn,
whose ridiculous name and funny appearance
never failed to set them laughing.
</p>
<p>
“But who is this old lady?” asked the girl who
had spoken to Timothy, and whom they came to
know later as Miss Genevieve Martin of Kentucky.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know,” answered Billie, smiling.
“I’ve only seen her once before, and the meeting
wasn’t very friendly then.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28'></a>28</span>
</p>
<p>
“Did she beat you with her stick?” asked Timothy
Peppercorn.
</p>
<p>
“If I had said anything, she would have tapped
me on the head with the gold knob, I believe, but
I kept very still.”
</p>
<p>
“What happened?” asked Miss Martin, turning
to Elinor who was nearest her.
</p>
<p>
Elinor related the story of the poor little chambermaid
or “linen sorter,” as she was careful to
call her.
</p>
<p>
“What a brutal old wretch!” exclaimed the
other indignantly. “Does she expect to teach
manners to Americans by treating them like
this?
</p>
<p>
“Timothy, run quick and look at the hotel register
and see who she is.”
</p>
<p>
Timothy gathered his loose frame together
and rose to his feet. He was really not so tall
as he appeared when sitting, but he seemed all
arms and legs like a grand-daddy-long-legs.
</p>
<p>
“After I come back, will you have that swim?”
he demanded.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29'></a>29</span>
</p>
<p>
The girl nodded her head gaily.
</p>
<p>
“No one can ever resist that funny red-headed
boy,” she exclaimed to the others. “I don’t know
quite what it is about him. He is really one of
the best natured creatures alive, and he has had
a great deal to make him unhappy, too, but he
is always in a good humor.”
</p>
<p>
“What has happened to him?” asked Nancy,
who had a childish curiosity and was still young
enough to ask questions.
</p>
<p>
“His mother and his brother and sister have
all died of consumption. Timothy would be
delicate, too, but he is determined not to be, and
when he finishes college he is going to be an
engineer and live out of doors.”
</p>
<p>
“We are engineers,” put in Billie, “Papa and I
and it’s the nicest work in the world.”
</p>
<p>
Miss Martin laughed. She had taken a tremendous
fancy to these four nice young girls
who seemed so unaffected and natural. But Timothy
returned before she could reply.
</p>
<p>
“The military lady in the flap-brimmed hat,”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30'></a>30</span>
he announced, “is registered as Mrs. Paxton-Steele.
The meek young person at her side is
Miss Georgiana Paxton, and there appear to be
also in the family Edward Paxton and Clarence
Paxton, all of England.”
</p>
<p>
“Steele is a good name for such a stern old
personage,” said Genevieve.
</p>
<p>
“Well, ‘her is naught to we, nor we to she,’”
added Timothy, “so let’s go in bathing and forget
all about her.”
</p>
<p>
“Are you sure you feel strong enough, Timothy?”
asked his friend, looking at him critically.
</p>
<p>
“Of course I do, Genie,” answered the boy,
flushing as red as his ruddy upstanding hair.
</p>
<p>
“But I don’t want to lose my new friends just
as I have made them,” continued the charming
girl, changing the subject quickly and smiling
into Billie’s face. “Perhaps you will go with
us?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, may we?” cried Billie and Nancy in one
voice.
</p>
<p>
Mary and Elinor were no swimmers.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31'></a>31</span>
</p>
<p>
“Where are your mammas, then, so that I may
ask permission first?” demanded Miss Martin.
</p>
<p>
“We haven’t but one with us and she’s a
cousin, but here she is,” replied Billie.
</p>
<p>
Miss Martin had the easy gracious manners
of the South and she never permitted any one
in her company to feel awkward or strange for
long. She introduced herself and her friend,
Timothy Peppercorn, to Miss Campbell simply
and gracefully, and after a moment’s pleasant
chat she had learned Miss Campbell’s name and
the names of the four girls, and the swimming
party was arranged.
</p>
<p>
“How quickly things do happen once they begin,”
thought Billie, as she ran lightly into the
surf where they chose to bathe instead of going
to the pool which most people preferred. “If
old Mrs. Paxton-Steele, of England, hadn’t been
so quarrelsome with the chambermaid this morning,
we should never have stared at her on the
piazza. She would probably have passed us by
without noticing us at all. Then, we should not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32'></a>32</span>
have made friends with Miss Martin and that
funny Timothy-boy, and no one would have suggested
this glorious morning swim.”
</p>
<p>
She plunged under the foamy crest of a cool
green wave, rose breast high on another, shook
herself like a young water spaniel and made for
the raft with long overhand strokes.
</p>
<p>
Swimming was a real accomplishment with
Billie, although her father, who had brought her
up very much as he would have reared a son, had
not taught her this particularly boyish pastime.
She had learned to swim at the age of five from
an old peasant woman in a village on the coast
of Brittany, where they had spent a summer.
These old fisherwomen were the only swimming
masters on that sequestered beach. Billie could
still remember with something of a shiver the
ancient, gnarled creature with her skirts tucked
up about her wrinkled limbs, who, standing
waist-high in the water, had taught her the first
strokes. Hard as it had seemed at the time, she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33'></a>33</span>
had never ceased to be thankful for those early
lessons.
</p>
<p>
“My, but you’re a corker,” exclaimed Timothy
Peppercorn, breathlessly. “I thought Genevieve
was pretty good, but you’re the best I have ever
seen.”
</p>
<p>
“Thank you,” answered Billie, as she swung
herself on the raft.
</p>
<p>
Many other swimmers dotted the surf that
morning and groups of people in light clothes sat
about on the shining strand. Splendid palm trees
and poincianas made a cool green background to
the lovely shore, and Billie half closed her eyes
as she lay on the raft, so as to make a picture she
might carry in her mind always. She had not
noticed that Timothy was too winded to hoist
himself on the raft.
</p>
<p>
Her attention was presently attracted by a
frolicking group of swimmers coming toward the
raft. In the midst of them, puffing and snorting
like a Triton, was a jolly big fat man whom they
called Duffy. Mr. Duffy had a red rubber ball—not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34'></a>34</span>
much redder or rounder indeed than his own
face—which he was tossing ahead of them on
the water while the others raced to get it.
</p>
<p>
“Let’s get in the game,” called Timothy as the
ball skipped toward them over the waves.
</p>
<p>
Billie dived off the raft and came up just
where she had seen the ball strike, but some one
seized it and tossed it a score of yards away.
There is always a swimmer in a water party who
does reckless and dangerous things. This time it
was the individual who had seized the ball before
Billie could get it. One by one the other
swimmers left off chasing and made for shore.
Mr. Duffy, turning his immense frame over,
floated away on his back in happy oblivion. But
the stranger, pitching the ball again as far as
he could send it, challenged Timothy to race for
it.
</p>
<p>
It was in vain that Genevieve, who had at that
moment reached the raft, protested and looked
coldly at the man whose back was turned. Timothy
darted off in the water while the two girls
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35'></a>35</span>
watched his red head uneasily as it rose and fell
on the white-tipped waves.
</p>
<p>
Both swimmers reached the ball at the same
moment, struggled over it, and then that reckless,
inhuman stranger tossed it further out to
sea.
</p>
<p>
“Idiots!” cried Genevieve, beating her hands
helplessly together as she sat on the side of the
raft.
</p>
<p>
All the other swimmers had gone ashore now
and were making for the bath houses, while loiterers
on the beach were scattering to the tennis
courts and golf links or the morning concert in
Cocoanut Grove.
</p>
<p>
Suddenly Billie saw the strange man throw up
both hands with a loud cry, which sounded very
much like “Sharks!” and start to shore as fast as
he could go.
</p>
<p>
“Oh! Oh!” cried Genevieve, covering her face
with her hands.
</p>
<p>
Some twenty yards beyond Timothy they could
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36'></a>36</span>
just make out the ugly square nose and upstanding
fin of a big fish sticking above the water.
</p>
<p>
“Hurry, Timothy, hurry,” called the girl in an
agony of anxiety.
</p>
<p>
“I’m all right,” he answered faintly, but each
movement seemed to be weaker than the last and
suddenly he sank beneath the waves.
</p>
<p>
While Genevieve was calling for help toward
the now almost empty beach, Billie made a running
dive off the raft, and with long, clean
strokes, swam for the red head which appeared
on the surface once more.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37'></a>37</span><a name='chIII' id='chIII'></a>CHAPTER III.—TIMOTHY’S DROWNING.</h2>
<p>
When one is swimming in a great hurry minutes
change to hours and yards to miles, and to
a small human speck in the ocean the sky overhead
appears like an immense arc. As the eyes
of the human speck follow the horizon line, many
things seem to be happening in the circular zone
which girdles the whole world.
</p>
<p>
It was only an instant that Billie had turned
her eyes away from Timothy’s head, and yet in
that moment she saw first the shark, more frightened
than they were, making for the open sea;
then a seagull swooping down on the water.
Then she saw Genevieve standing irresolutely
on the raft; next a line of sea, and finally the
reckless stranger who had enticed Timothy to
race for the ball and left him to his fate. He
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38'></a>38</span>
was still swimming desperately, as if a whole
army of sharks was at his heels.
</p>
<p>
“Coward,” thought Billie, as she cut through
the waves as neatly and swiftly as the prow of a
little ship. She was swimming on one side, far
down, making a wide circular motion with her
right arm.
</p>
<p>
As she neared the struggling boy, she called
out cheerfully:
</p>
<p>
“All right, Timothy. Keep up a minute. I’m
almost there.”
</p>
<p>
He tried to smile, and beat the water feebly
in a last effort to save himself. But when she
was almost at arm’s-length distance, he sank
again. Billie dived under, caught him by his
stiff red hair and pulled him to the surface.
</p>
<p>
Loungers on a beach are not apt to notice
what is really going on among the bathers. A
man has been drowned in sight of a hundred
spectators and no one knew that anything had
happened. So it was with the group of people
lying on the sand. They had not even looked
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39'></a>39</span>
seaward for ten minutes, and were as oblivious
to the fact that a struggle for life was taking
place in the water, as if they had been sitting
in an inland meadow.
</p>
<p>
Once again, Genevieve called weakly: “Help,
help!” but her voice was lost in the sound of the
surf as it broke on the shore. Then, at last,
seeing she could not attract anybody’s attention,
she jumped into the water and began swimming
slowly out toward Timothy and Billie. But she
was frightened, and fright in deep water takes
the form of a creeping, all-pervading exhaustion.
Once she turned and tried to go back to the raft,
but the strong current carried her along faster
than she could swim. It was all she could do
now to keep her own head above water, and she
forgot Billie and Timothy and everything in the
world but her determination to stay on top.
</p>
<p>
In the meantime, Billie, with Timothy in tow,
was also in the grip of the current.
</p>
<p>
“Take your own time, Billie,” she heard her
own voice saying, and she half smiled when she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40'></a>40</span>
remembered how often she had heard her father
use those very words in the early days of her
swimming. “I can’t keep this up forever,” her
thoughts continued, as her arm began to feel
numb and the pressure became almost unbearable.
</p>
<p>
It had not come into her head that she could
let Timothy go and save herself. Her father
had had his own peculiar ideas in bringing up
his little daughter, and it was a very courageous
heart that now thumped and thumped in her athletic
young frame. One hand still gripped Timothy’s
hair while with the other she paddled
gently and let herself drift along. Hours seemed
to pass. It was really only a few minutes. Billie
closed her eyes.
</p>
<p>
“I’m so tired, Papa,” she whispered. “Don’t
think I’m a coward if I——”
</p>
<p>
Bump! Straight they drifted into something
large and soft and yielding.
</p>
<p>
It was Mr. Duffy whose enormous frame was
floating on the water like an empty cask.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41'></a>41</span>
</p>
<p>
“Br-r-r!” he spluttered, as his head went under
and came up again. It was impossible to
sink that vast bulk of human frame.
</p>
<p>
Billie had just sense enough to call out as he
struggled to see what had collided with him:
</p>
<p>
“Keep on floating—we’re—almost—drowning.”
</p>
<p>
“Hey, hey! Little girl, tired out, are you?
Hold on tight. Why, you’ve got a boy there.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” gurgled Billie. “He’s about all—in—don’t
move—I must rest.”
</p>
<p>
Timothy opened his eyes.
</p>
<p>
“Did I faint?” he asked in a weak, shaky voice.
</p>
<p>
“Something like it,” called Mr. Duffy. “Hold
on, boy, and don’t talk.”
</p>
<p>
At last Billie’s arm was relieved of the weight
which had grown so heavy that she thought
every moment it would break. But she had kept
Timothy’s nose above the water line, and she
breathed a sigh of satisfaction.
</p>
<p>
“What’s that! What’s that on my foot?” demanded
Mr. Duffy, not daring to move and unable to see over
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42'></a>42</span>
the hemisphere of his portly
frame.
</p>
<p>
Billie looked up mechanically. In her relief
and weariness, she had really forgotten that
Genevieve existed in the world, and there was
her new friend clinging desperately to the fat
man’s foot and breathing hard.
</p>
<p>
Billy could hardly keep from laughing! What
a funny picture they must make to the people
on shore: a big whale surrounded by small fry;
or an ocean liner being pushed seaward by three
little tugs.
</p>
<p>
“It’s just another tired swimmer,” she answered
at last.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Duffy’s round, good-natured face wrinkled
into a delightful smile.
</p>
<p>
“I seem to be a sort of general life-preserver,”
he exclaimed. “Do the people on land think we
are playing a game? Why doesn’t somebody
come out and help this poor boy before we float
on out to sea?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43'></a>43</span>
</p>
<p>
“I’m awfully sorry, but we’re too tired to call
for help,” said Billie, apologetically.
</p>
<p>
“Of course you are, little girl. But you’ve
done a brave thing, so don’t reproach yourself
and don’t be frightened any of you. I’m going
to send out one of my chest notes.”
</p>
<p>
With that, Mr. Duffy roared out “Help, help!”
in such deep bass tones that the ocean fairly
rocked with the sound. Just as he called, Billie
noticed a girl run up to the group of people on
the beach and point toward the sea. It was
Georgiana Paxton, she was almost certain. Two
men in white flannels, taking off their coats as
they ran, dashed into the surf. As they swam,
they appeared like two great white fish leaping
out of the water. Presently they came alongside
the human flotilla and swimming to the
other side of Mr. Duffy’s huge frame, paused
for breath.
</p>
<p>
“What’s the matter?” asked one.
</p>
<p>
“Matter?” cried Mr. Duffy with half-comic
irritation. “Let go of me. Do you think I’m the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44'></a>44</span>
strong Turk who lifts a dozen people at once?
There’s a poor boy would have drowned if it
hadn’t been for this brave young lady, and
there’s another young lady about to go under,
and you sitting on the beach playing mumbly-peg
when human life is at stake! If I hadn’t been
an animated cork there’d have been three drownings
this morning. Get busy and look alive.”
</p>
<p>
“I’m all right,” said Billie, as one of the young
men swam toward her. “Look after the others
please.”
</p>
<p>
It was Genevieve and Timothy who were
towed ashore while Billie and Mr. Duffy slowly
followed the rescuing party, swimming side by
side and chatting as if they had been old friends.
</p>
<p>
“I’m glad there’s a happy ending to this little
story,” gurgled the fat man, moving easily along
in the water like a man walking on shore.
</p>
<p>
“I am, too,” answered Billie, pillowing her
cheek on a green wave and propelling herself
gently toward shore. She felt as if she could
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45'></a>45</span>
swim forever now; so much has the state of
mind to do with swimming.
</p>
<p>
“You are a brave girl,” went on Mr. Duffy.
“How far had you towed the boy?”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know. Not as far as it seemed, I
suppose. The current kept us going. All I had
to do was to hold his head above water.”
</p>
<p>
“Wasn’t he the boy who raced for the rubber
ball?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes.”
</p>
<p>
“What became of the other fellow, the one
who threw the ball,” demanded Mr. Duffy, looking
out seaward as if he expected to see him also
struggling in the waves.
</p>
<p>
“He was frightened at a shark and swam in.
I suppose he thought Timothy was coming, too.
But he needn’t have made such a fuss. The
shark was one of the scary kind.”
</p>
<p>
“The low contemptible coward! Did he leave
you to look after that drowning boy?”
</p>
<p>
“He didn’t know Timothy was drowning, you
see,” said Billie, trying to be just.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46'></a>46</span>
</p>
<p>
But they had reached the shore now and there
was no time to argue about it. A crowd of people
had surrounded Timothy, who was still weak
and exhausted. Billie and Mr. Duffy hurried up
the beach to the bath houses.
</p>
<p>
“Would you know that cowardly fellow again
if you were to see him?” he asked, when they
had reached the pavilion.
</p>
<p>
“No,” she answered, “I never saw anything
but the back of his head when he swam ashore.”
</p>
<p>
Nancy appeared at the bath-house door. She
had been dressing during the last fifteen minutes
and had missed “Timothy’s drowning,” as the
girls always called it afterwards.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Billie,” she cried to her friend who was
hastening toward her, “I have just had such a
fright!”
</p>
<p>
“I hoped you had missed it, Nancy,” interrupted
Billie.
</p>
<p>
“Then you saw it, too?”
</p>
<p>
“Saw it? I was in it.”
</p>
<p>
“In the fight?” demanded Nancy.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47'></a>47</span>
</p>
<p>
“We are talking about different things, Nancy.
What is it you saw?”
</p>
<p>
“I saw that terrible old English lady, what’s-her-name,
Mrs. Paxton-Steele, beat a boy with
her stick! She took him by the arm and beat him
well across the back, and called him ‘Low, dastardly
coward,’ and he howled like a whipped
dog, and when I said ‘Oh, don’t,’ she turned on
me and I thought she was going to hit me with
her stick, too.”
</p>
<p>
“That must have been the boy who threw the
ball,” cried Billie. “I’m glad some one punished
him. What did he look like?”
</p>
<p>
“How could I tell? He was all dripping wet
in a bathing-suit, and his face was turned away.”
</p>
<p>
In a few words and with very modest allusions
concerning her connection with the saving of
Timothy Peppercorn, Billie described the accident
to Nancy.
</p>
<p>
“That is the reason why I asked you what the
boy looked like, Nancy. I just wanted to see
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48'></a>48</span>
which of all the men in this hotel he was,” Billie
added, after she had finished the story.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Billie,” cried her friend, putting her
arms around Billie’s neck, “you are the bravest,
finest girl in the whole world.”
</p>
<p>
“But it was that nice fat Mr. Duffy who saved
us all, child. Go hug him.”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t belittle your brave deeds,” said Nancy,
“and don’t try to excuse that cowardly man who
called out ‘sharks!’”
</p>
<p>
As the two girls disappeared into the pavilion,
a young man about seventeen emerged from one
of the alleys. He was tall and well-built with
handsome, regular features and brown hair, but
there was an angry flush on his face and a snarl
on his weak, rather effeminate mouth. He did
not leave the pavilion, but waited until Nancy and
Billie came out of the bath-house, and as they
walked arm in arm down the corridor, he took a
long look at their two faces and followed slowly
after them, his hands in his pockets.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49'></a>49</span>
</p>
<p>
“Little cats!” he ejaculated, as he turned toward
the hotel, “I’ll get even with them yet.”
</p>
<p>
Miss Campbell and the other girls were sitting
in big wicker chairs on the piazza. They, too,
had heard nothing of Timothy’s drowning, and
were laughing and chatting together while they
absorbed iced fruit drinks through long straws.
</p>
<p>
“My dear children,” cried Miss Campbell,
“how long you have been. Here are some delicious
lemonades especially ordered for us by that
mysterious individual, Mr. Ignatius Donahue. I
really wish he would come forth from his hiding-place.
He reminds me of an attentive ghost.”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50'></a>50</span><a name='chIV' id='chIV'></a>CHAPTER IV.—A RACE AND WHAT CAME OF IT.</h2>
<p>
“I feel rather badly about leaving the poor old
Comet in his stable all day,” observed Billie, who
had taken a long rest after her adventure in the
water that morning and was enjoying a trip in
the Firefly, Mr. Donahue’s motor-boat.
</p>
<p>
“He will be wondering why you brought him
down if you use his rival the very first afternoon,”
said Elinor.
</p>
<p>
They were skimming over the blue water of
Lake Worth, which was dotted with every kind
of pleasure craft imaginable. The shores of
Palm Beach shimmered gold in the afternoon
sunshine and across the lake came the faint
sound of music from the band in the Grove.
</p>
<p>
“Any kind of machine is glad to take a rest,
my dear, human or otherwise,” put in Miss
Campbell. “No doubt the Comet is well pleased
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51'></a>51</span>
to stop whirring and whirling for awhile and
stay quietly in the garage.”
</p>
<p>
“You see how real our motor car is to us,” said
Billie to Edward, who was running the boat.
“We feel toward him just as we should toward
any faithful animal, a horse or a dog——”
</p>
<p>
“Or a cat,” put in Mary, who loved cats to the
exclusion of all other dumb creatures.
</p>
<p>
“I could never love a cat the same as a horse
or a dog or a motor car,” cried Billie with enthusiasm.
</p>
<p>
“Now, I’ve planted my affections on a canary
bird,” said Elinor, “and I wouldn’t exchange him
for the finest cat in seven kingdoms. He is always
in a good humor. He sings and carols all
day long and his little heart palpitates with joy
when I let him hop out and perch on my finger.”
</p>
<p>
Edward’s face lighted up. He had been listening
silently to the chatter of the young girls
while he guided the boat somewhat nearer the
beautiful tropical shores which bordered the lake,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52'></a>52</span>
and slowed down so that they could have a passing
glimpse of this fairyland.
</p>
<p>
“We have a bird,” he said presently. “I’d feel
mighty bad if anything should ever happen to
him. He’s the finest little fellow you ever saw.”
</p>
<p>
“What kind is he?” asked Elinor with polite
interest.
</p>
<p>
“A mocking bird.”
</p>
<p>
“A mocking bird?” repeated Billie. “How I
should love to hear one sing! What is he like?”
</p>
<p>
“He’s a beautiful brown,” returned Edward,
warming to the subject. “His tail and wings
are tipped with white and he has a white breast.
His little eyes are so bright and black, they see
everything that happens. He knows he can sing,
too. He’s just as proud of it as we are. He’s a
wonder, I can tell you, and he is as fond of us
as we are of him. I found him when he was
little. His wing was broken and he had fallen
out of the nest. His name is Dick and he’s just
like a member of the family.”
</p>
<p>
“What a dear little fellow!” cried Billie. “I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53'></a>53</span>
would like to have him hop on my finger and look
at me with his shiny little black eyes. Do you
live near Palm Beach, Edward? Couldn’t we
motor over and see him some time?”
</p>
<p>
There was a whirring noise behind them. The
boy turned quickly without answering and looked
back. Another motor-boat was coming toward
them at a clipping rate.
</p>
<p>
“Would you like a little race?” he asked, rather
wistfully. “I know that boat, and ours can
beat it, if that’s the same fellow who ran it the
other day.”
</p>
<p>
“Wouldn’t it be dangerous?” asked Miss
Campbell, smiling indulgently in spite of her objections.
</p>
<p>
The Motor Maids exchanged amused glances.
They had long had a secret conviction that there
was nothing the little lady enjoyed more than to
sit on the back seat of the Comet and close her
eyes, while they took a breathlessly swift run up
the Cliff Road at West Haven.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t think it would be dangerous, ma’am,”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54'></a>54</span>
replied Edward. “This is a dandy little boat if
it is handled properly.”
</p>
<p>
“And you’re sure you know how to handle it,
Edward?”
</p>
<p>
“Certainly, ma’am. I’ve raced in it before and
raced this other boat, too.”
</p>
<p>
“Did you win the race, Edward?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, ma’am,” replied the boy earnestly.
</p>
<p>
“I have no objections to trying it again, then,
Edward,” said Miss Campbell, “only don’t upset
us in the water, whatever you do.”
</p>
<p>
The girls laughed happily. Who could be solemn
in this magical place where everything was
beautiful? The sky, the water, the land, even
the faces of the most ordinary human beings
were glorified by the bewitching atmosphere.
</p>
<p>
“You are a precious little sport, cousin,” cried
Billie, kissing her relative on her peach-blossom
cheek, “with all your baby-blue eyes and your
laces and frills, you enjoy a race as much as any
of us.”
</p>
<p>
“And why not, my child? I’m not a stock or a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55'></a>55</span>
stone always to stay planted in one spot and
never to have any good times.”
</p>
<p>
The other boat had come alongside of them
now.
</p>
<p>
“Want to race?” called out the young man at
the engine, who by the way was the same person
who had called Nancy and Billie “cats” that very
morning in the bathing pavilion.
</p>
<p>
“All right,” answered Edward. “We’ll start
now if your friend will give the signal, and race
to the little house on the shore.”
</p>
<p>
There were two other people in the boat, one
a boy who sat in the stern. He wore smoked
glasses and his hat was pulled well down over
his face. The other was a girl.
</p>
<p>
“Why, it’s the same girl who was walking this
morning with the terrible old English lady,”
whispered Nancy. “Her name is Georgiana
Paxton.”
</p>
<p>
But no one replied, for the boy with the
smoked glasses had called out: “One—two—three—off
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56'></a>56</span>
you go,” and the two boats had shot
out over the water.
</p>
<p>
It was glorious fun skimming along the lake
in the pretty little craft. Shores flew past and
sail boats and canoes were left far behind. The
other boat kept well ahead of them for awhile.
Over the noise of its chugging engine they could
hear the scornful laugh of the young man who
was running it.
</p>
<p>
“What an impolite person,” observed Miss
Campbell. “There is nothing ridiculous about
any of us, I hope.”
</p>
<p>
“He’s laughing because he thinks he’s going
to beat us,” said Edward over his shoulder.
“But wait and see what happens when we beat
him. We are almost at the goal now.”
</p>
<p>
Gradually the Firefly began to get up speed,
and chug and work as the other boat would, it
could not keep abreast of the graceful swift-moving
craft which shot ahead and presently slowed
up just opposite the knock-kneed, rickety little
boat-house on the shore.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57'></a>57</span>
</p>
<p>
The girls were standing up, and Miss Campbell
was waving her handkerchief in her enjoyment
and excitement.
</p>
<p>
“It was thrilling,” she cried. “I have never
actually been in a race before, and how beautiful
to be the winner. If I had known there was going
to be a race I should have offered a prize for
us to win, ourselves. The young man should
never have laughed. It is unlucky to laugh before
a race is decided.”
</p>
<p>
At that moment the other boat came up.
</p>
<p>
“The race was not a fair one,” exclaimed the
young man, whose name we will presently find is
Clarence Paxton. He was frowning and biting
his lips angrily.
</p>
<p>
“What was wrong about it, I’d like to know?”
demanded Edward.
</p>
<p>
“You had the start of at least half a minute.”
</p>
<p>
Edward’s blue eyes took on a steely look.
</p>
<p>
“You are mistaken,” he said quietly.
</p>
<p>
“I tell you I am not mistaken,” began the
other, when Miss Campbell interfered.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58'></a>58</span>
</p>
<p>
“Edward,” she said, in her gentlest and most
charming manner, “this would be a good place
to land and have our tea. Perhaps these young
people will join us.”
</p>
<p>
The girl in the other boat turned toward her
gratefully.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, thank you,” she said, “we should love
to.”
</p>
<p>
“That will be very nice,” answered Miss
Campbell. “An excellent way to celebrate a
well-fought battle,” she added, blinking her blue
eyes a little mischievously.
</p>
<p>
“It will be impossible, Georgiana,” said Clarence,
“I have an engagement at the hotel at five
o’clock.”
</p>
<p>
“An engagement!” she exclaimed. “Why you
don’t know anyone to make an engagement
with.”
</p>
<p>
“Is it any of your business one way or the
other?” he replied angrily.
</p>
<p>
“If this young man is anxious to get back,”
put in Miss Campbell, “don’t detain him, please.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59'></a>59</span>
We shall be delighted to take you home later in
our boat, if you care to come ashore, and your
friend, too.”
</p>
<p>
Georgiana flushed with pleasure. She was a
pale thin girl with a rather plain face and sad
dark eyes.
</p>
<p>
“I should love to come,” she said, looking wistfully
at the Motor Maids. “I have no friends
here.”
</p>
<p>
“Will you come, too?” asked Miss Campbell
hospitably of the boy who wore glasses.
</p>
<p>
“Do come, Edward,” cried Georgiana, and the
other Edward started at hearing his name called
out.
</p>
<p>
The boy took off his slouch hat diffidently.
</p>
<p>
“Are you sure there will be room in the boat?”
he asked.
</p>
<p>
“Plenty,” said the other Edward.
</p>
<p>
“I believe I will come,” he said with a shy
eagerness that the girls noticed at once.
</p>
<p>
“Take your friends ashore,” commanded Miss
Campbell sternly to Clarence, “and then you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60'></a>60</span>
need not trouble about them further. They will
be our guests.”
</p>
<p>
Clarence obeyed sheepishly, and as the two
boats pointed toward the beach, Miss Campbell
remarked:
</p>
<p>
“The only way to avoid a quarrel with that
singular young man was to ask them all to tea.
But I’m sure if it gives them any pleasure it is
well worth the trouble.”
</p>
<p>
Presently they found themselves on a smooth
beach, just back of which in a little hollow was
a lovely grove of palm trees.
</p>
<p>
“What a perfect place for a picnic,” cried
Elinor. “Do the fairies dance here by moonlight,
I wonder?”
</p>
<p>
“Isn’t it sweet?” cried Mary, clasping her
hands rapturously.
</p>
<p>
The prow of the other boat then grounded on
the beach and the boy and girl jumped out so
eagerly, that it was plain to be seen they were
glad to get rid of the ill-natured Clarence.
</p>
<p>
“I can’t tell you how much pleasure this will
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61'></a>61</span>
give us,” said Georgiana to Miss Campbell, a
slight tremble in her voice.
</p>
<p>
“It gives me a great deal of pleasure, too, I’m
sure,” replied the other cordially. “Your name
is——”
</p>
<p>
“Georgiana Paxton, and this is my brother,
Edward Paxton.”
</p>
<p>
Miss Campbell introduced them to her charges,
and nobody took any more notice of Clarence,
who busied himself with his engine and occasionally
cast a surly glance at the others.
</p>
<p>
Edward and Elinor had carried the tea basket
and a package of sandwiches into the little
hollow, and the rest now followed.
</p>
<p>
“What a beautiful spot, what an ideal place,”
they cried, as they grouped themselves about the
little dell, while Elinor opened her tea basket and
laid out the dainty crockery and the kettle.
</p>
<p>
There was a spring bubbling in the dell, and
the ground all about was carpeted with a thick
bed of moss. The yellow jasmine grew in abundance there
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62'></a>62</span>
and violets were thickly strewn in
the shady corners.
</p>
<p>
“What an enchanting place——” Miss Campbell
was saying, when suddenly Edward, the
chauffeur, said “Sh-h-h,” and pointed to the upper
branches of an immense old pine at the edge
of the grove.
</p>
<p>
“Listen,” he whispered.
</p>
<p>
Hidden among the thick green foliage, a bird
was singing the most lovely, trilling song imaginable.
The liquid notes poured from his little,
quivering throat like so much pure gold. It was
such a joyous song and they were so afraid he
might stop that they hardly dared breathe. Elinor
clasped her hands rapturously and tears
came into her eyes.
</p>
<p>
“It’s a mocking bird,” whispered Edward,
proudly.
</p>
<p>
So much absorbed and enchanted were they
with the music that they did not notice what was
taking place on the beach. Two steps up and
they would have seen something which would
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63'></a>63</span>
have caused them a far different emotion. Clarence,
who had no business whatever in the Firefly,
leaped into it for a moment, then back again
into his own boat, and presently the chug-chug
of his engine broke the spell of the mocking
bird’s song.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64'></a>64</span><a name='chV' id='chV'></a>CHAPTER V.—THE TWO EDWARDS.</h2>
<p>
“‘Knowest thou the land of the citron
bloom,’” sang Elinor as she busied herself with
the tea things.
</p>
<p>
There were not quite enough cups to go
around and the two boys waited until two of the
girls had finished; but it was only one more excuse
for lingering in that lovely spot; pulling the
yellow jasmine and the sweet violets and dipping
their hands in the cool waters of a little brook
which had hidden itself in a corner of the dell.
</p>
<p>
Georgiana showed a kind of awkward, shy joy
in being with the four young girls. So absorbed
was she in her new happiness that she had not
noticed, and indeed, no one had observed, a very
curious coincidence.
</p>
<p>
It was not until Elinor had poured out two
fresh cups of tea and was saying: “Sugar or
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65'></a>65</span>
lemon, Mr. Paxton—er—I mean Edward—I
mean—why, which Edward are you?” that they
waked up.
</p>
<p>
Edward Paxton had removed his black glasses
and slouch hat and stood revealed as Edward,
the chauffeur, or his living image. The others
formed an interested circle around the two boys,
who were certainly very much alike. They had
the same blue eyes and black hair; the same
handsome, regular features. They were indeed
the same height.
</p>
<p>
“It is only when they are together that I could
tell them apart,” cried Nancy, with Irish obscurity.
</p>
<p>
“Why, they are as alike as two peas in a pod,”
ejaculated Miss Campbell.
</p>
<p>
The two boys stood face to face and regarded
each other curiously.
</p>
<p>
“I feel as if I were looking in a mirror,” said
Edward Paxton gravely.
</p>
<p>
“And they are both named Edward,” put in
Georgiana. “Isn’t it strange?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66'></a>66</span>
</p>
<p>
“What is your last name?” asked Edward
Paxton.
</p>
<p>
“My name—is Edward l’Estrange,” he said.
Then he looked anxiously at the others, but no
one gave any sign of having heard the name before
and he appeared to breathe a sigh of relief.
</p>
<p>
“There is this difference between them,” announced
Billie, who, when she had observed a
person’s face, usually finished by looking at their
chests and shoulders exactly as her father would
have done, “Edward Paxton is not as broad as
Edward l’Estrange, and he is much paler.”
</p>
<p>
“It’s because Edward’s always ill,” said his
sister, in a half-accusing tone. “He has headaches
and pains and side aches. Grandmamma
says he is determined to be delicate.”
</p>
<p>
Edward Paxton flushed painfully.
</p>
<p>
“Is that why you wear those smoked glasses?”
demanded Billie.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, the glare on the water gives me a headache.”
</p>
<p>
“How dark and hideous everything must
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67'></a>67</span>
look,” went on Billie. “The sky must always be
cloudy and the water gray and the woods a dusty
green. I should be very unhappy, I’m sure, if I
had to wear them. One could never see anything
as it really was.”
</p>
<p>
“He doesn’t,” cried his sister. “He’s always
sad and sorrowful and quiet—and—and moody,
too, Edward, you know you are.”
</p>
<p>
“I’m not,” exclaimed her brother. “Or rather
if I am, I suppose I have enough to make me so.
Grandmamma——” he began, and then paused
and bit his lips.
</p>
<p>
There was an awkward silence. The others
recalled the terrible grandmamma who wielded
her gold-headed cane with almost as much freedom
as an ancient warrior did his battle-axe.
Miss Campbell felt sorry for the boy and girl.
No doubt the fierce old lady led them a wretched
life.
</p>
<p>
“Well, well,” she said, patting Edward Paxton
on the arm. “No one can judge for any one else,
because no one knows how much another has to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68'></a>68</span>
bear. You will grow strong and well down here,
I’m sure, my dear, and I hope you and your sister
will spend a great deal of time with my girls.
They are so merry and bright, you can’t help
catching the fever when you are with them.
They have made a new creature of me, I assure
you.”
</p>
<p>
“It’s you who started all the happiness
a-going, dearest cousin,” said Billie, giving her
relative a little squeeze.
</p>
<p>
“And speaking of going,” went on Miss
Campbell, “we must be tearing ourselves away
from this charming place. But you will bring
us here again, will you not?” she added, turning
to the other Edward, who had been silently assisting
Elinor to gather up the tea things and
store them in the basket.
</p>
<p>
“Certainly, ma’am,” he replied, “if you wish
it.”
</p>
<p>
Miss Campbell could not help feeling that this
quiet, rather masterful boy was really the host
of the beautiful afternoon party, and not merely
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69'></a>69</span>
the engineer of the boat. But he knew his duties
as engineer, and his place, too, evidently, for he
rarely spoke except to answer questions. With
the basket under one arm and a cushion under
the other he hurried over and jumped into the
boat.
</p>
<p>
“He is really much the more manly of the
two,” thought Billie, as she watched his self-reliant
movements, “but I suppose that old
grandmamma would be enough to cow any one’s
spirit.”
</p>
<p>
Presently they were seated in the Firefly and
their youthful engineer shoved off from shore.
They were drifting lazily along over a miniature
ripple of waves which the movement of the boat
had set in motion, when Edward l’Estrange gave
an exclamation of surprise and annoyance. As
he bent over the machinery, they waited for the
whir of the motor, but the engine was silent and
the little boat bobbed up and down like a piece
of driftwood that had shifted all responsibility
in life. Motor boats are much like delicate people
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70'></a>70</span>
who are subject to sudden and unexpected
attacks. The girls, therefore, were not surprised
that the engine was indisposed, and they began
chatting and laughing gaily with their new
friends, while Edward l’Estrange got out his
box of tools and set stoically to work.
</p>
<p>
“Why don’t you help him, Edward?” asked
Georgiana. “I always thought you knew so
much about motor-boats.”
</p>
<p>
Edward Paxton rose languidly and joined his
counterpart. The girls thought they had never
seen such a spiritless boy, and secretly they preferred
the Edward who was their own first discovery.
</p>
<p>
“There is nothing to do,” said Edward l’Estrange,
“because there is nothing the matter with
the engine, as far as I can see.”
</p>
<p>
“Why, the gasoline tank is empty,” exclaimed
the other.
</p>
<p>
“What?” cried the young engineer. “But that
is impossible, unless there is a leak somewhere,
because I just filled it this morning. By Jove,”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71'></a>71</span>
he added, with a steely light in his eye that
looked dangerous, “well of all the——” his voice
died away and the two boys exchanged a long
and meaning look.
</p>
<p>
The girls could not help laughing. They were
like the two Dromios, these two young men. The
resemblance was even more striking when Edward
Paxton had waked into life.
</p>
<p>
“But what is it?” demanded Miss Campbell.
It was so difficult to have anything but agreeable
sensations in this pleasant land.
</p>
<p>
“All the gasoline’s gone,” said the engineer.
“There’s not a drop of it left in the tank and we
started with plenty. There has been foul play
somewhere,” he added in a lower voice.
</p>
<p>
“Are you sure you started with plenty?” asked
Billie, who was accustomed to the appetite of a
gasoline motor engine.
</p>
<p>
“Perfectly,” answered the self-reliant young
man. “I cleaned and overhauled the machinery
and filled the tank this morning.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72'></a>72</span>
</p>
<p>
“There’s lots of gasoline here,” observed Mary
Price, “only it’s all outside.”
</p>
<p>
Suddenly they became aware that there was a
strong odor of gasoline in the air and that the
waters about them were covered with a bluish
gray film.
</p>
<p>
“Ho ho,” cried Edward Paxton, with some
excitement. “I’ve found the leak. A hole has
been bored straight through the side of the boat,
tank and all.” He was leaning far over the boat.
“It’s just above the water line,” he added.
</p>
<p>
“But who could have played such a trick as
that?” exclaimed Miss Campbell.
</p>
<p>
The English brother and sister looked uncomfortable.
There was no doubt in the minds of
the company regarding the author of that practical
joke, but no one cared to accuse Clarence
Paxton since his cousins were their guests.
</p>
<p>
“What are we going to do, boy?” asked Miss
Campbell helplessly. “How are we going to get
back? I don’t suppose you can find any more
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73'></a>73</span>
gasoline in this wilderness, even if you could
mend the boat.”
</p>
<p>
“No, the hotel is the nearest place,” replied
Edward l’Estrange.
</p>
<p>
He knitted his brows and sat thinking for a
moment, while the others waited in respectful
silence. Surely this Edward must have been well
accustomed to taking charge of things.
</p>
<p>
“There is nothing to be done,” he said at last,
“but for me to go back to the hotel and get the
motor car.”
</p>
<p>
“But how will you get there?” demanded
Billie. “It must be at least ten miles.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I’ll manage,” he answered evasively.
</p>
<p>
“And must we wait here?” asked Miss Campbell.
</p>
<p>
Edward hesitated for some time before he replied.
</p>
<p>
“I live not far from here. If you don’t mind
walking a little, you could wait at my home until
I come back with the motor.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74'></a>74</span>
</p>
<p>
“And then we could see the mocking bird,”
put in Elinor.
</p>
<p>
The boy’s face lit up.
</p>
<p>
“Yes.”
</p>
<p>
“It would be very, very kind of your—of you
to take such a crowd of us in, Edward,” said
Miss Campbell. “We should appreciate your hospitality.
I don’t seem to fancy stopping in this
lonely spot all that long time, especially after
dark.”
</p>
<p>
Once more they landed and formed a silent
procession along an old wagon road from the
beach through a great grove of trees. It was a
gloomy place in the late afternoon. The branches
draped in gray Spanish moss made a mournful
picture.
</p>
<p>
“We look like a troop of spirits,” whispered
Mary to Billie.
</p>
<p>
The two girls had lingered a little behind the
others.
</p>
<p>
“What spirit was it, do you think, that sprung
a leak in our boat?” whispered Billie.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75'></a>75</span>
</p>
<p>
“It was the spirit of mischief. And it might
have been very serious mischief, too, if it had
not been for our wise little engineer.”
</p>
<p>
“We should have had to sleep in the dell.
Cousin Helen could have taken the launch and
perhaps Georgiana, because she is so frightened
and nervous. I am so sorry for her, Mary, and
for all of them, even that wretch of a Clarence.
They are all orphans, you know, and wards of
their fierce old grandmother. Georgiana and
Edward lived in Canada until a few years ago.
That is why they speak with so little accent, I
suppose.”
</p>
<p>
Presently the wagon road emptied itself, like
a tributary into the main stream, into what had
once been a broad carriage road, a splendid avenue
bordered with giant pine trees.
</p>
<p>
“Why, this must lead to a mansion,” exclaimed
Billie as they turned into the avenue. “I suppose
Edward works for the family who live here; but,
somehow, I never can imagine his working for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76'></a>76</span>
any one. He seems so—so different from chauffeurs
and people like that in general.”
</p>
<p>
They walked along silently for a few minutes.
There was only the last twittering of the birds
to break the hushed stillness of the place.
</p>
<p>
“I feel as if I were approaching an enchanted
palace,” whispered Elinor, who had dropped back
with her two friends.
</p>
<p>
“It was on just such an evening as this, I
fancy, and along just such a road that the prince
came to waken the sleeping beauty,” exclaimed
Mary.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, look,” cried several voices at once, and
suddenly right in front of them loomed an immense
house.
</p>
<p>
Four classic Doric columns supported the two
galleries on the first and second floors, and at
one side rambled a huge wing which must at one
time have been the servants’ quarters, in this fine
old mansion.
</p>
<p>
“Is this where you work, Edward?” asked
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77'></a>77</span>
Miss Campbell, without intending to be patronizing.
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” he replied. “It is my home,” he added,
as he led them to the first gallery and banged
the knocker loudly.
</p>
<p>
Presently footsteps sounded in the empty hall,
and an old colored woman carrying a lighted
candle opened the door and peered at them curiously.
</p>
<p>
“Mammy, will you look after these ladies,
please? They will wait here until I can get a
motor car from the hotel. Our boat was wrecked
a while ago.”
</p>
<p>
“Come right in, ladies,” said the old colored
woman, leading the way into a large almost empty
room at one side of the hall.
</p>
<p>
A grand piano stood at the end. On the walls
a few old portraits were half visible in the flickering
candlelight. At one side was a long mahogany
sofa covered with faded tapestry, and
the only other piece of furniture in the immense
apartment was a small supper table set for one.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78'></a>78</span>
</p>
<p>
“I’ll jes’ go up and fetch little Missy, Marse
Edward,” whispered Mammy, while the others
strolled about looking at the portraits and Elinor
touched a soft chord on the piano.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79'></a>79</span><a name='chVI' id='chVI'></a>CHAPTER VI.—THE GRAY MOTOR CAR.</h2>
<p>
It was not long before the door opened and
a young girl bearing a lighted candle in each
hand entered the room.
</p>
<p>
“This is my sister, Virginia,” said Edward
l’Estrange, introducing her to Miss Campbell.
</p>
<p>
Billie could hardly conceal her surprise, and
Nancy, who always forgot not to speak out, was
about to exclaim: “Why, it’s the little chambermaid,”
when a reminding nudge from Elinor
stopped her.
</p>
<p>
It was indeed the little chambermaid, although
the fluffy pale gold hair was no longer tucked in
a knot under the maid’s cap, but hung in a shining
mass down her back and was caught at the
neck with a pink ribbon. Virginia was like a
charming woman of the world. Her manners
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80'></a>80</span>
were so gracious and easy that they began to feel
at home at once in the ghostly old place.
</p>
<p>
“These Southern girls,” Miss Campbell was
thinking, “how graceful and well-bred they are!”
</p>
<p>
“I’m so glad my brother brought you here,”
said the girl in the soft musical voice that had attracted
them in the morning. “It would have
been lonely for you on the beach and he may be
some hours in getting back.”
</p>
<p>
“Before you go, Edward,” put in Elinor, “may
we not see the mocking bird? Or has he gone to
bed?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Dick? He’ll wake soon enough if he
knows there is company,” said Virginia. “Do
get him, Edward.”
</p>
<p>
But Edward had already left the room and
presently returned with a large covered cage
which he placed on the table.
</p>
<p>
“Won’t all these people and lights frighten
him?” asked Billie.
</p>
<p>
“Not Dick,” replied Edward. “He’s a gentleman,
first and foremost, and loves the ladies.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81'></a>81</span>
And he’s a very obliging rascal. Watch him
open one eye when I take off the cover.”
</p>
<p>
When the brown linen cover was removed,
the graceful little fellow was disclosed, standing
on one foot, the other drawn up under his body,
which gave him a ministerial appearance, as if
he were about to deliver a speech.
</p>
<p>
“Why, what an elegant little gentleman he is,”
cried Elinor delightedly. “Look at his neat
brown coat and his white waistcoat. He might
have just dressed to go to church.”
</p>
<p>
Dick cocked his head on the side and opened
one of his intelligent little black eyes as much as
to say:
</p>
<p>
“Of course I’m a gentleman. I belong to the
Mocking Bird family.”
</p>
<p>
But he was well pleased with the attentions
of these young people, for he hopped gravely out
and stood on Edward’s finger looking at them
critically.
</p>
<p>
“Darling little Dicky,” exclaimed Virginia.
“He’s the very life of this house. I’m sorry
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82'></a>82</span>
you’re not to hear him sing. He makes it a rule
never to sing after dark. The dawn is his favorite
time.”
</p>
<p>
Dick gave an apologetic little chirp. He regretted
evidently that it was impossible to display
his musical powers at this time.
</p>
<p>
Edward regarded him with the yearning gaze
of a father toward his first born.
</p>
<p>
“You are very fond of him, aren’t you?” asked
Billie, noticing the look of pride and affection in
the boy’s eyes.
</p>
<p>
“He adores him,” put in his sister, laughing.
“But you had better go now, Edward. Uncle
Peter said he would be around with Alexander in
a few minutes.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, that reminds me, how are you going to
get back to Palm Beach?” demanded Miss Campbell.
</p>
<p>
Edward blushed and looked at his sister, who,
although she was the younger, was not so shy.
</p>
<p>
“He’s going to ride,” she said.
</p>
<p>
Just then the old colored woman the boy and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83'></a>83</span>
girl so lovingly addressed as “Mammy,” entered
the room and walking straight over to Edward
Paxton, said:
</p>
<p>
“Marse Edward, Alexander is at de do’.”
</p>
<p>
The other Edward laughed.
</p>
<p>
“You didn’t know I had a twin, did you, Mammy?”
</p>
<p>
The woman held up her hands in amazement.
</p>
<p>
“Fo’ de Lord,” she said, “I thought ’twas my
young Massa.”
</p>
<p>
Virginia, too, was amazed at the strong resemblance
between the two boys.
</p>
<p>
“But I must be hurrying away,” said Edward
l’Estrange.
</p>
<p>
They followed him to the front door. Georgiana
Paxton wanted to send word to her grandmother
that they were safe. Miss Campbell had
another errand for him, and Edward Paxton
whispered something gravely in his ear. The
two boys looked at each other. Already, they
had established a sympathetic understanding.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84'></a>84</span>
Then the American boy mounted an old bony
mule and rode off down the avenue.
</p>
<p>
Billie now understood why Edward l’Estrange
did not want to explain how he was to get back
to the hotel. But Virginia laughed gaily. It was
impossible to say whether it was really a pleasure
to her to be entertaining these strangers in
her dismantled old home or whether her manners
were so perfect that she was able to make it appear
so. One thing was plain, however. She
was determined not to be recognized as the
chambermaid of the morning.
</p>
<p>
They strolled back into what they strongly
suspected was the only furnished room on that
floor, and distributed themselves about on the
sofa and two chairs.
</p>
<p>
“Won’t you play for us, dear, on that beautiful
big piano?” asked Miss Campbell, who was
really enjoying the adventure.
</p>
<p>
“I’m afraid I don’t play well enough to play
before company. It was papa’s piano. He was
a musician. Perhaps some of you will play, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85'></a>85</span>
I’ll open the door so that mamma can hear the
music from upstairs.”
</p>
<p>
“Is your mother ill?” asked Miss Campbell.
“Are you sure we won’t disturb her?”
</p>
<p>
“She is always ill,” answered the girl sadly.
“She never leaves her room. But music was
once her greatest pleasure and I know she would
enjoy hearing some one else play besides me.”
</p>
<p>
“Edward,” said Georgiana, “won’t you play
for Miss l’Estrange?”
</p>
<p>
The quiet English boy became suddenly animated.
He had been leaning on the piano ever
since he had been in the room. Perhaps his
fingers were itching to touch the keys, for when
he sat down and began to play the notes seemed
to run from their ends like water from the mouth
of a fountain. He played so beautifully that
the girls began to comprehend why he never appeared
to be hearing anything that was said
around him.
</p>
<p>
“Supper is served, Miss Virginia,” announced
Mammy at the door, just as they were crowding
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86'></a>86</span>
around the young pianist with exclamations of
pleasure.
</p>
<p>
“I’m sorry we can’t eat in the dining-room,”
said Virginia, “but, as you see, the table is too
small.”
</p>
<p>
And that was the only apology she made that
evening.
</p>
<p>
“My dear child,” cried Miss Campbell, “you
ought not to have taken all this trouble for us.
I am afraid we have put you out terribly.”
</p>
<p>
Virginia smiled and took her hand.
</p>
<p>
“It is a pleasure. What would Mamma say
if she knew we let our guests leave the house
hungry?”
</p>
<p>
The Motor Maids will never forget that supper
party. They were taught a lesson in good
manners and hospitality that they had not
dreamed was possible.
</p>
<p>
They found themselves in a big old-fashioned
kitchen. In the center was a table covered with
a splendid damask cloth and set with the most
motley and variegated pieces of glass and china
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87'></a>87</span>
ever beheld together outside of a curiosity shop.
At Miss Campbell’s place was a beautiful Bohemian
glass tumbler. Two silver mugs, one
marked “Edward” and the other “Virginia,”
stood at the sides and at the other places were
several pressed glass tumblers and one or two
cracked and chipped teacups of rare old china.
Miss Campbell had the only silver knife and fork
on the table. In the center was a crystal bowl,
which had been cracked and mended, filled with
oranges.
</p>
<p>
Uncle Peter, who was Mammy’s husband, and
the ex-butler of this fine old mansion, now appeared
in an old blue swallowtail coat with brass
buttons. He bore a platter of crisp, fragrant
smelling bacon, and Mammy walked behind him
with a dish of cornbread.
</p>
<p>
That was all the supper and no food ever tasted
better to the hungry tourists.
</p>
<p>
“After all,” thought Billie, “everything depends
on who gives the party.”
</p>
<p>
After his duties as butler were finished, Uncle
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88'></a>88</span>
Peter passed through the room bearing a large
tray, and those who were facing him could not
help noticing the appetizing and dainty meal set
upon it on plates of old-fashioned blue and gold
china. Billie caught a glimpse of half a broiled
chicken and a small glass dish of jelly.
</p>
<p>
“It’s for the sick mother,” she thought, as she
followed the others back into the living room,
and it came to her with a throb that this boy and
girl were probably denying themselves every
luxury in life and working hard to look after
their invalid mother. “I feel so worthless and no
account when I think of those two,” she thought.
“I have never had to give up anything in all my
life so that some one else could have it.”
</p>
<p>
Elinor played for them after supper, and Virginia
also played and sang some delightful old
negro melodies. Finally, when she struck up the
“Suwanee River,” the girls joined in and the
house was filled with music.
</p>
<p>
“Oh dear, I’m having such a good time,” exclaimed
the young Southern girl. “What a treat
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89'></a>89</span>
it is to be with other girls! I wish you were all
going to make me a long, long visit.”
</p>
<p>
“Perhaps you could make the girls a visit in
West Haven,” said Miss Campbell. “That
would be a nice change for you from this Southern
climate.”
</p>
<p>
“It would be beautiful but I can’t leave
mother——”
</p>
<p>
“Miss Virginia,” said the voice of Mammy in
the hall, “your ma wants you quick——”
</p>
<p>
Virginia darted from the room and they heard
her running up the stairs. A door opened somewhere
above and for an instant there was a
sound of weeping, which was shut out immediately
when the door was closed.
</p>
<p>
“Dear, dear! I’m afraid we have disturbed
Mrs. l’Estrange,” said Miss Campbell. “How
very unfortunate!”
</p>
<p>
They sat in a silent row listening for more
sounds, but the place was as still as a tomb.
</p>
<p>
Elinor began to talk with Edward in a low
voice about music. Georgiana and Mary presently became
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90'></a>90</span>
absorbed in conversation, and Miss
Campbell, with her head against the back of the
sofa, dropped off into an after-dinner nap.
</p>
<p>
Billie and Nancy rose and held a whispered
conference at the window.
</p>
<p>
“Let’s do it,” said Nancy to some suggestion
of Billie’s. “What can harm us in this wilderness?”
</p>
<p>
“Mary,” said Billie, “if Cousin Helen should
wake, tell her we are taking a little stroll in the
avenue. We can’t endure this close, still place
any longer.”
</p>
<p>
The two girls tiptoed from the room and presently
found themselves in the broad road which
led to the house. How beautiful the place looked
by moonlight, with its galleries and noble Doric
columns! It was too dark to see the stained and
discolored walls, the staring, empty windows, but
even in this light they could discern the rickety
look of the house which appeared to have slipped
over on one side.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91'></a>91</span>
</p>
<p>
“I can easily imagine this place was haunted,”
whispered Billie.
</p>
<p>
They were standing in the avenue, examining
the old building.
</p>
<p>
“Heavens, how you give me the creeps,” exclaimed
Nancy, taking her friend’s hand and
starting to walk.
</p>
<p>
They were like ghosts themselves as they
flitted down the avenue in their white dresses.
They felt it would soon be time for Edward to
return, and they planned to meet him at the entrance
and ride back.
</p>
<p>
“There he is now,” said Nancy at last.
</p>
<p>
Far down the avenue they could hear the whirring
of a motor engine.
</p>
<p>
“He’s traveling fast,” observed Billie, listening
with practised ears to the sound of the machinery.
“I didn’t know the Comet could take such a
pace as that.”
</p>
<p>
“How strange for him to have no light,” observed
Nancy.
</p>
<p>
“Very careless, but I suppose something happened to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92'></a>92</span>
the light. I don’t think we’d better try
to stop him,” she added hurriedly. “He’s going
like the wind,” and she drew Nancy back into
the path beside the road.
</p>
<p>
To their surprise, as the machine approached,
they saw that two men were in it, and, strange
to say, it was not the Comet but a gray car which
slowed up gradually as it neared the house.
</p>
<p>
“Better stop here,” said one of the men in a
low voice. “So this is the old place,” he added.
“Poor things! Poor things!”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t see why you should pity them,” said
the other man. “You have more reason to hate
the mother, than not.”
</p>
<p>
There was silence.
</p>
<p>
“Now, Ignatius Donahue,” went on the second
man,—the girls’ hands met in a frightened
clasp and they pressed together behind the trees,—“I
didn’t bring you out here to sentimentalize.
I want to talk business. We are both looking for
the same thing. If I find it, I tell you frankly,
I shall destroy it——”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93'></a>93</span>
</p>
<p>
“You scoundrel,” cried the man called Ignatius
Donahue. “You thief, you sneak——”
</p>
<p>
The two men grappled and began to fight.
They fought like wild cats, first in the car and
then on the ground. Presently the one on top
hit his adversary a terrific blow on the head. He
fell backward and lay quite still in the road.
</p>
<p>
Nancy was about to scream but Billie put her
hand over her mouth.
</p>
<p>
The man kneeled on the ground and felt the
other’s heart.
</p>
<p>
“Stone dead,” he muttered.
</p>
<p>
He lifted the man in his arms and, staggering
under the weight, carried him through the thick
undergrowth of what had once been the park of
the old place and deposited him on the ground.
</p>
<p>
Then, with a terrified glance over his shoulder,
as if he were already afraid the ghost of the dead
man might follow him, he rushed blindly to the
car, cranked it up, backed off and was gone like
the wind.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94'></a>94</span><a name='chVII' id='chVII'></a>CHAPTER VII.—THE COWARD.</h2>
<p>
Billie and Nancy, too frightened to speak or
move, were as still as one of the old pine trees
which had shielded them from the gaze of the
two men. As the whirr of the motor died away
in the distance, the girls heaved a deep sigh almost
at the same moment, as if they had awakened
from a terrible dream.
</p>
<p>
“Billie have we just seen a man killed?” whispered
Nancy, her knees knocking together with
fright.
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” whispered Billie unsteadily.
</p>
<p>
“What shall we do?”
</p>
<p>
“Wait and let me think. Must we go and
alarm the people in the house or wait for Edward
l’Estrange? You wouldn’t dare go over there
with me and see if the man is really dead, would
you, Nancy?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95'></a>95</span>
</p>
<p>
“No-o-o,” cried Nancy. “Never, never, never!”
</p>
<p>
“Why not tell Edward Paxton?”
</p>
<p>
“Why not?” answered the other, and pressing
close together, the frightened girls hurried back
to the house as fast as their shaking knees could
carry them.
</p>
<p>
It was gloomy enough in the great dark hall
with only one candle sputtering in a bracket on
the wall, and they were not reassured when on
opening the door they found the living room
empty.
</p>
<p>
“Where on earth are they?” exclaimed Nancy.
</p>
<p>
“Perhaps they couldn’t stand it in here either,
and have gone out doors. Let’s look for them on
the piazzas.”
</p>
<p>
Hand in hand they hastened from the house,
looking back fearfully at their fantastic shadows
dancing on the walls.
</p>
<p>
“Thank heavens, I hear them,” said Nancy,
pulling Billie toward the low sound of voices at
the end of one of the side galleries.
</p>
<p>
“Don’t you say anything, Nancy. Leave me to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96'></a>96</span>
manage it. You will be certain to frighten Cousin
Helen.”
</p>
<p>
“Why, there you are,” called Miss Campbell
herself, as the two girls approached. “Somebody
started a false alarm that the sound of a
motor had been heard and we came out hoping
it was Edward. I was beginning to get uneasy
for fear you had wandered too far.”
</p>
<p>
“We just walked down the avenue and back.”
</p>
<p>
“Didn’t you hear the motor?” demanded
Mary, who scented something in Billie’s manner.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, but it was not Edward, evidently. I
suppose there are lots of motors around the
neighborhood.”
</p>
<p>
“What did you see? Anything interesting?”
asked Elinor. “You both look as if you had seen
a ghost.”
</p>
<p>
“You are pale,” exclaimed Miss Campbell, “or
is it the moonlight? And Nancy’s hands are cold
as ice. Come in the house, child. You should
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97'></a>97</span>
not be out in this night air. You are trembling.
Are you ill?”
</p>
<p>
“Keep it up, Nancy,” whispered Billie in her
ear.
</p>
<p>
“I feel a little faint,” said Nancy. “Perhaps
I’d better go in and sit down a moment.”
</p>
<p>
Miss Campbell, who was consumed with anxiety
if one of her girls had the suspicion of a
pain, drew her into the house, made her lie on
the sofa and took off her own coat to throw over
her.
</p>
<p>
In the meantime, Billie pulled Edward Paxton’s
sleeve and whispered, “Wait, I have something
to tell you.”
</p>
<p>
“What is the matter,” he asked, wonderingly.
</p>
<p>
“When Nancy and I were in the avenue, an
automobile drove up and stopped near us. Two
men, who were in it, began fighting. They
fought out of the car and on the road and
one of them hit the other an awful blow. The
man is dead, I’m afraid, because the other man
pulled him over into the bushes and left him
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98'></a>98</span>
there. Then he jumped into the motor and
rushed away. The dead man is over in the
bushes down there now.” She pointed down the
avenue. “What do you think we’d better do?”
</p>
<p>
Billie had been too agitated to realize how
strange the story sounded until she put it into
words.
</p>
<p>
“He’s there, I tell you,” she exclaimed impatiently,
when Edward made no reply. “You look
as if you didn’t believe me.”
</p>
<p>
“It does sound very much like a curious dream.
Why should people be killing each other in this
wilderness?”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know, I’m sure. But it happened just
as I told you.”
</p>
<p>
“You are not playing a joke on me, are you?”
</p>
<p>
There was nothing in the world which irritated
Billie so much as to have her word doubted.
Her father had often said that she was absurdly
truthful, and as a matter of fact she stuck to the
letter of the truth with scrupulous care. She
always believed other people, because she expected
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99'></a>99</span>
the truth. And she seldom got anything
else. It, therefore, seemed incredible to meet
some one who could believe that she would invent
a tale just for the sake of excitement.
</p>
<p>
With a slightly contemptuous spark in her fine
gray eyes, she turned to Edward and said,
</p>
<p>
“If you have any doubts on the subject, you
had better come with me and see for yourself.”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t you—think—we’d better wa-a——”
he stammered, and broke off with an embarrassed
laugh.
</p>
<p>
Then it was she realized that Edward was timid.
She could hardly call it cowardice because
the boy followed her; but from the corner of her
eye she could see that it was with reluctant steps.
</p>
<p>
She felt sorry for him, somehow. Probably
his grandmother had taken all the spirit out of
him. That is why he permitted his cousin Clarence
to ride over him, and his old granny, too.
</p>
<p>
“Are you certain he was dead?” he whispered.
</p>
<p>
“No, I’m not certain at all. We ought to hurry,” she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100'></a>100</span>
continued, “if he isn’t, we might be able
to help him.”
</p>
<p>
Half way down the avenue, she stopped at two
tall pine trees standing closely together like a
loving pair which had grown up side by side.
</p>
<p>
“I think it was just here,” she whispered. “We
were behind these two trees, Nancy and I, when
they began to fight, and it was along this
smudged place that he pulled the man’s body and
pitched it into that clump of bushes.”
</p>
<p>
Edward paused and drew in a deep breath. A
brave soldier about to go under fire could not
have been more resolute than he when he finally
doubled his fists and plunged through the bushes
followed by Billie. Although the moon was
bright, they could not see any signs of an object
having been dragged over the ground. The
elastic undergrowth had sprung back into place
and the body might have lain there forever under
the trees and no one the wiser.
</p>
<p>
“Was this the place?” he whispered, trying to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101'></a>101</span>
keep Billie from seeing that he was shaking all
over.
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” she answered, parting the branches of
the acacias. “It was right in here, I think.”
</p>
<p>
But there was no sign of any creature, living
or dead, in the high grasses.
</p>
<p>
They searched, growing bolder every moment.
</p>
<p>
At last, with a sigh of deep relief, Edward
said,
</p>
<p>
“Dead or alive, he’s gone. And still you say
it wasn’t a dream?”
</p>
<p>
Even the most patient and amiable natures
have their turning points. Now, Billie, with all
her high spirits, was singularly free from outbursts
of temper. From her father she had inherited
a happy, even disposition, always willing
to see the best and overlook the worst. But the
young girl was very tired that evening. It had
been only a few hours since she had saved Timothy
Peppercorn’s life, and that followed by the
shock of seeing a man struck down, had unnerved
her.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102'></a>102</span>
</p>
<p>
She regretted afterwards the words which
came to her lips now, for she was terribly and
uncontrollably angry and she hardly knew that it
was herself who spoke them.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps, after all, Billie was at that moment
an unconscious instrument of fate, because her
impetuous, passionate outburst was the means of
changing the lives and destinies of several actors
in this little history.
</p>
<p>
“How dare you accuse me of speaking a falsehood?”
she said. “You are a coward and you
are glad we didn’t find the man’s body because
you are afraid. You haven’t even the spirit or
courage to believe the truth. You are afraid of
everything and everybody. Afraid of your
grandmother and your cousin. You are afraid
of me now. You are afraid of being sick; of
losing your eyesight. You are afraid of the dark,
and you are afraid of the sun. You shut it out
with black glasses. You may look like Edward
l’Estrange. But you are not really like him. He
is brave and strong. He is not afraid to fight to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103'></a>103</span>
make a living and take care of his sick mother.
This afternoon when your cousin told that falsehood
about the boats starting wrong, you knew
it was a lie, but you were afraid to stand up for
what was right. It was your cousin who
punched a hole in our boat this afternoon. You
know that perfectly well; but you will be afraid
to tell him so.
</p>
<p>
“Just change places with Edward l’Estrange
once and let him fight your battles and you will
see what courage is.”
</p>
<p>
Billie stopped. The fire of her anger had
burned out almost as soon as it had started. She
felt shaken through and through and very tired.
</p>
<p>
“I wonder if Vesuvius feels like this after one
of her eruptions,” she thought, shamefacedly.
</p>
<p>
But there was no time for any inward reflections
just then, for her attack on Edward bore
very quick results. Instead of giving fire for fire
as a real coward would do with some one smaller
and weaker than himself, Edward buried his face
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104'></a>104</span>
in his hands and burst into a perfect tempest of
sobs.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, don’t,” cried Billie, remorsefully. “It was
cruel of me to speak in that way. I was very
angry, but it’s all over now, and I apologize. I
must have hurt you awfully. Of course you’re
not a coward.”
</p>
<p>
“No, no. You are quite right. I am a coward.
Every word you said was true. I am afraid of
everything: the daylight and the dark and
draughts and people. I am even afraid of the
only thing I want to do in the world—be a musician;
because my grandmother threatens to cut
me off with a shilling if I touch the piano. I am
afraid of being poor. You were right in saying
I was afraid of the truth, because it hurts, and
what you said hurt me terribly. I sometimes
wonder why I was ever born. I have always
been so miserable.”
</p>
<p>
“You poor boy,” said Billie, all the kindness in
her nature rising to the top. “I am so sorry I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105'></a>105</span>
hurt you. Won’t you forgive me?” she asked,
putting her hand on his arm.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, yes,” he answered. “I’m not angry with
you. I wish I could be mad just once. I have
always been afraid of scenes.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, don’t say again you wish you had never
been born, because perhaps some day you may be
awfully glad you were, and then you would be
sorry you had said it. After all, you have an
easier time than Edward l’Estrange. Think how
hard he has to work, and Virginia, too. If you
were to change places——” she began, when the
English boy interrupted her.
</p>
<p>
“Do you think we are very much alike?” he demanded
with some excitement in his voice.
</p>
<p>
“Wonderfully.”
</p>
<p>
“Why not change places then? Our accents
are not so very different. I can run boats and
automobiles and Edward l’Estrange can——”
</p>
<p>
“Can fight your battles,” Billie thought, but
she said aloud, “Can take your place for a
while?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106'></a>106</span>
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” went on Edward, warming up to the
subject. “I would gladly give him my allowance.
I dare say it’s more than he makes now and he
could have what I made, too. I don’t want it.
All I want is a little freedom.”
</p>
<p>
“But what about your sister and Clarence?
Wouldn’t they find out?”
</p>
<p>
“Clarence wouldn’t because he has never noticed
Edward l’Estrange and doesn’t know anything
about the likeness. If it were necessary,
we could tell Georgiana. But I would rather
not. It will be a secret between us three.”
</p>
<p>
“And are we to trust you to run the Firefly
and take us out in the motor?” asked Billie,
doubtfully.
</p>
<p>
“Won’t you please?” asked the boy so earnestly
that Billie smiled.
</p>
<p>
“It may not be necessary,” she said. “Edward
has to be won over first. There he is at
last,” she added, looking down the avenue. “We
had better hurry back. They will be missing
us.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107'></a>107</span>
</p>
<p>
It was not long before the Firefly party was
hastening back to the hotel in the faithful red
motor.
</p>
<p>
“Billie,” whispered Nancy, “what happened?
Did you find him? And was it Mr. Ignatius
Donahue? And was he dead——”
</p>
<p>
“No, Nancy dear, the dead man had run away,
thank heavens, whichever one he was.”
</p>
<p>
Nancy gave an hysterical little giggle.
</p>
<p>
“Then he was alive?”
</p>
<p>
“What a foolish question, child. You don’t
suppose the dead can walk, do you? ‘Dead men
rise up never.’”
</p>
<p>
“Ugh—” shivered Nancy. “Oh, dear, but I’m
glad that we didn’t really see a murder. Which
did you think struck the blow?”
</p>
<p>
“How can I tell,” answered Billie. “But I
would much rather it would be Ignatius Donahue,
if it was our Mr. Donahue, who was struck
down. Because the other man ran away.”
</p>
<p>
Early the next morning just as sunrise flooded
the world with a mellow light, Virginia l’Estrange
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108'></a>108</span>
tiptoed from the front door of her house
and climbed into the back of an old spring wagon
where she sat down composedly in a rocking-chair.
</p>
<p>
“Git up, Alexander,” said Uncle Peter, who
occupied the driver’s seat, and off they started
down the avenue.
</p>
<p>
As they turned into the main road, they noticed
a man sitting on the ground holding his head in
both hands.
</p>
<p>
“Stop, Uncle Peter,” ordered the girl. “Are
you ill?” she asked.
</p>
<p>
The man looked up with a dazed expression.
</p>
<p>
“I—I think I am,” he answered.
</p>
<p>
“Would you like to ride?”
</p>
<p>
“You are very kind.”
</p>
<p>
The man climbed into the wagon, and suddenly
grasping his head with a groan, fainted dead
away.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, mercy, what shall we do, Uncle Peter?
Take him home?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109'></a>109</span>
</p>
<p>
“We’ll have to, little Missy. We cyant car’
him to the hotel.”
</p>
<p>
The long-suffering Alexander once again
turned his face toward the house and trotted
patiently up the avenue. Perhaps he thought he
was not to take his usual early morning trip to
Palm Beach. By the time they had reached the
end of the avenue, the man opened his eyes.
</p>
<p>
“Where am I?” he asked.
</p>
<p>
“This is my home,” said the young girl. “My
name is Virginia l’Estrange. You had better
stay here until you feel better. You will look
after him, won’t you please, Mammy?” she said
to the colored woman who had come around the
side of the house at the sound of approaching
wheels. “This gentleman is ill.”
</p>
<p>
“Virginia l’Estrange,” repeated the man, getting
slowly out of the wagon with the help of
the two old colored people. “Virginia,” he said
again, presently, stretching himself wearily on
the long sofa while the colored woman bound a
wet cloth about his forehead.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110'></a>110</span>
</p>
<p>
In the meantime, Virginia, herself, rocking
gently back and forth, was again on her way
to the hotel.
</p>
<p>
“I suppose it’s all right, Uncle Peter,” she said.
“We couldn’t leave a sick man in the road.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, little Missy,” said the colored man, “an’
they ain’t nothin’ in our house wuth takin’ anyhow
ceppen it be the gran’ pianner.”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111'></a>111</span><a name='chVIII' id='chVIII'></a>CHAPTER VIII.—MR. DUFFY GIVES A PARTY.</h2>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“O’er&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;waters&nbsp;&nbsp;so&nbsp;&nbsp;blue,&nbsp;&nbsp;o’er&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;waters&nbsp;&nbsp;so&nbsp;&nbsp;blue,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We’re&nbsp;&nbsp;afloat,&nbsp;&nbsp;we’re&nbsp;&nbsp;afloat&nbsp;&nbsp;in&nbsp;&nbsp;our&nbsp;&nbsp;birch-bark&nbsp;&nbsp;canoe.”<br />
</p>
<p>
Elinor’s sweet fresh voice, floating across the
waters of Lake Worth, seemed a part of the rippling
accompaniment made by the waves as they
lapped the bow of the Firefly. Edward, the
young engineer, absorbed in listening to the
music, forgot he was guiding a boatful of people
down the lake to an evening party at Mr. Duffy’s
villa.
</p>
<p>
“Be careful,” whispered Billie, sitting near
him. “Look out for that boat on the right.”
</p>
<p>
Edward started from his dream, smiled, and
turned the Firefly out of the track of the oncoming
boat.
</p>
<p>
“That’s a pretty song,” said Timothy Peppercorn,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112'></a>112</span>
“only to be strictly truthful, you should
substitute—‘We’re afloat, we’re afloat in our little
motor-boat.’”
</p>
<p>
“There’s nothing poetical about the smell of
gasoline,” interrupted Elinor. “It out-perfumes
all the orange blossoms and yellow jasmine at
Palm Beach.”
</p>
<p>
“Speaking of gasoline,” Miss Campbell here
broke in, “Edward, did you find out any more
about that leak that came in the Firefly the other
night? Was it—do you—er, could it possibly
have been——”
</p>
<p>
Miss Campbell hesitated. She never liked to
make accusations on circumstantial evidence, but
it certainly looked very much as if Clarence Paxton
had done the deed, out of spite.
</p>
<p>
Edward hesitated and Billie replied for him.
</p>
<p>
“The engineer is busy at this moment, Cousin
Helen,” she said, “but I will tell you that if it
wasn’t the person who shall be nameless, he got
a good beating anyhow for some one else’s sins
the next day.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113'></a>113</span>
</p>
<p>
“Is it possible?” exclaimed the little lady with
great concern. “Dear, dear. Who beat him?”
</p>
<p>
“The other one.”
</p>
<p>
“It all sounds very mysterious,” laughed Timothy,
“like the letter at the trial of the Knave of
Hearts:
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“‘I&nbsp;&nbsp;gave&nbsp;&nbsp;her&nbsp;&nbsp;one;&nbsp;&nbsp;they&nbsp;&nbsp;gave&nbsp;&nbsp;him&nbsp;&nbsp;two,<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though&nbsp;&nbsp;they&nbsp;&nbsp;were&nbsp;&nbsp;mine&nbsp;&nbsp;before.’”<br />
</p>
<p>
“What are these Paxton people like?” asked
Genevieve Martin.
</p>
<p>
“They are English and peculiar,” answered
Nancy. “Two orphans and one almost-orphan,
and their grandmother. The two orphans are
very nice and the almost-orphan is—well, rather
disagreeable. The grandmother beats them
when she is angry——”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Nancy,” exclaimed Elinor.
</p>
<p>
“She does, for I saw her at Timothy’s drowning.
She beat Clarence.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114'></a>114</span>
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Clarence. I should think she would have
to beat him. But Edward is really quite nice.”
</p>
<p>
The others laughed at this, and the engineer
bent down over his machine as if motor engines
were the only thing in life that interested him.
</p>
<p>
“Here we are,” cried the ever-watchful Billie,
pointing to a pretty villa which was one of many
built on a long strip of land separating the lake
from the ocean. “This is Mr. Duffy’s villa. I
can tell it by the three lanterns hung in the boat-house.
He told me that would be the Duffy signal.”
</p>
<p>
Since Billie’s bravery in keeping Timothy
from drowning, Mr. Duffy had been her devoted
follower. It was impossible for him to conceal
his admiration, he said. He wished all the world
to know that she was the finest young lady in
three kingdoms and all the states. He brought
his wife to the hotel to call on Miss Helen and
the girls, but chiefly to exhibit the brave young
woman who had kept two heads above water at
the same time and not lost either of them. And
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115'></a>115</span>
then he wished to give Billie a party at his own
house, and he invited her and all her friends who
were at the moment in speaking distance on the
piazza. Timothy Peppercorn and Genevieve
Martin were included, and the three English
cousins who happened to be near at the time.
The Firefly party could see their launch now
making for the pier.
</p>
<p>
“Why, look,” exclaimed Mary. “Clarence
isn’t running the boat to-night. Edward Paxton
is doing it.”
</p>
<p>
“Good!” cried Billie. “It’s a fine sign.”
</p>
<p>
“Sign of what, pray?” demanded Elinor.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, nothing,” began Billie, when she was interrupted
by a burst of music played by three
negroes on a guitar, a banjo and a triangle which
sent a silver tinkling note through the melody.
Mr. Duffy, himself, was at the boat landing looking
as large as a white elephant in his spick
and span linen suit.
</p>
<p>
“This is a pleasure and an honor, Madam,”
he exclaimed, helping Miss Campbell out of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116'></a>116</span>
boat as gallantly as if he had been a slender
young cavalier. “Mrs. Duffy and I have been
looking forward to this, I can tell you. The old
woman’s on the porch. She never walks a step if
she can avoid it, you know.”
</p>
<p>
Mr. Duffy always called his wife “the old
woman,” but it was simply a term of endearment
for she was not really old at all. She was almost
as fat as her husband, however, but at the top of
her mountainous figure was the most charmingly
pretty face imaginable, as pink and white as a
wax doll’s and always wrinkling with little smiles
which played hide-and-seek among her many
dimples. Her eyes were as blue and innocent as
an infant’s and her naturally blonde hair, made
blonder by artificial means, gave her face a
singularly childlike appearance.
</p>
<p>
“Are you all here?” she cried, giving a funny
little elephantine run down the piazza, as they
came up the steps. “I do hope no one stayed behind.
I wish I had told you to bring more people.
Mr. Duffy and I love boys and girls, because we
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117'></a>117</span>
haven’t any of our own, I suppose. If I wasn’t
so fat and lazy, I think I should like to be at the
head of a big orphan asylum. It would be different
from any orphan asylum I have ever seen.
The children should have such a good time they
would forget they had no parents. The little
girls should have pretty dresses,” she rattled on,
“and not those hideous dun colored things, and
every Saturday they should have a party——”
</p>
<p>
“You see how my old woman does run on,”
laughed Mr. Duffy, winking at the others. “Orphan
asylums are her particular fad, but I don’t
believe any Methodist Association would engage
her if they heard her views first.”
</p>
<p>
“If they ever do make you a superintendent of
an orphan asylum, Mrs. Duffy,” called Billie, on
her way up the stairs to leave her scarf and
wrap, “you will have your hands full because we
shall all join the orphan brigade.”
</p>
<p>
“Bless you, child, Mr. Duffy and I would be
only too glad to make a little asylum just for you
all alone if you should ever feel inclined to try it,”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118'></a>118</span>
returned the warm-hearted soul who had yearned
in vain for a little girl of her own.
</p>
<p>
Mr. and Mrs. Duffy’s winter home was built
very much as they were: broad and commodious
and of an exceedingly comfortable disposition.
</p>
<p>
There was plenty of room in the big parlors
for dancing; on the broad piazzas were lounging
chairs and hammocks, and in the tropical garden,
now lighted with Japanese lanterns, settees
had been placed in all the prettiest nooks.
</p>
<p>
Other guests now began to arrive from the
neighboring villas, and our Motor Maids soon
found themselves at what Nancy called “a real
party.”
</p>
<p>
And, oh, how busy Mrs. Duffy was introducing
all the boys and girls! She chose Timothy
Peppercorn as her assistant and the incongruous
pair kept the couples spinning about the room
like so many human tops.
</p>
<p>
“No one shall ever have a stupid time in my
house,” declared the good woman, leading forth
young men and maids to the dance like so many
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119'></a>119</span>
sacrificial lambs. But once things got into
swing, she had no further trouble except with
poor, awkward, shy Georgiana. The young English
girl danced a hoppety dance instead of the
American glide, and it was difficult to obtain a
partner for her a second time. At last Mr.
Duffy himself was called into action. With rivers
of perspiration pouring down his rotund
countenance, like spring freshets down the side
of a mountain, he gallantly piloted Georgiana
through the mazes of the waltz. But Mr. Duffy
had a light and graceful step, in spite of his
enormous weight.
</p>
<p>
There was a dancer at the ball whose enjoyment
was so apparent that Mrs. Duffy felt a
thrill of gratification whenever she noticed his
flushed, happy face. It was Edward—which Edward,
you may guess for yourselves, but he
danced as Cinderella must have danced when she
knew that at midnight she must fly. Billie was
his partner as often as Timothy Peppercorn
would permit. As soon as Edward had arrived
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120'></a>120</span>
he had pushed his way through the crowd and
gone straight to her side.
</p>
<p>
“How many dances may I have, Miss Billie?”
he asked, with a candor not unusual in young
Southerners.
</p>
<p>
“As many as you can get,” replied Billie,
laughing, but with a bright flush on her cheeks,
and Edward had taken her at her word.
</p>
<p>
Elinor, who was standing next to Billie when
this happened, turned away and bit her lip. It
was only because she had been saving up something
to tell Edward about a duet she wanted
him to try some day with her at the hotel, and
Edward had merely bowed to her and gone
away. Such things are disturbing even to the
most dignified and high-bred natures, and it was
natural for poor Elinor to wonder why Edward
Paxton had never been near her since the evening
they all spent together at Virginia’s home.
</p>
<p>
Elinor had many partners that night, but Edward
was not one of them. Her feelings were
hurt and she could not resist a slight coldness
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121'></a>121</span>
toward Billie, who seemed to have forgotten that
she had three intimate comrades and was always
talking to Edward in a low voice and stopping
immediately any one came near.
</p>
<p>
“Won’t you and Timothy come and stroll in
the garden with us, Elinor?” asked Billie, as they
passed each other between dances.
</p>
<p>
“Thanks,” replied Elinor, with all the dignity
of an injured queen, “I would rather stay indoors.”
</p>
<p>
So it was that Billie and Edward strolled alone
in the garden.
</p>
<p>
“How are you getting on?” she asked.
</p>
<p>
“Splendidly,” he replied. “I gave Clarence
such a licking as he’ll never forget, and yesterday
when the old lady started to rap me in the
head with her cane, I caught it in my hand and
said ‘Don’t do that again.’ I could hardly keep
from laughing. But she has treated me very
politely ever since. I have to watch out for Clarence,
though. He is just waiting for a chance
to get at me. It will be from behind. That’s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122'></a>122</span>
why I have to be careful. And I want to warn
my twin brother. I suppose we’ll find him at the
boat landing.”
</p>
<p>
“How do you like being in another boy’s
shoes?” Billie asked, as they turned in the direction
of the boat-house.
</p>
<p>
“It’s rather jolly having plenty of clothes and
nothing to do but amuse myself; but I’d just as
soon live at the foot of Mount Etna as take a
permanent job with my present grandmamma.
</p>
<p>
“Nonsense,” said Billie, “I believe you will find
her all right if she learns to respect you. She
has no respect for her grandchildren. That’s
why she bullies them with her cane.”
</p>
<p>
Stretched on the cushioned seat of the Firefly,
they found the other Edward gazing at the
stars, the very picture of contentment.
</p>
<p>
“Hello,” he exclaimed, looking up as he stifled
a yawn. “How’s the party?”
</p>
<p>
“Fine!” answered Edward l’Estrange.
</p>
<p>
“I wish you could have come, too,” said Billie.
</p>
<p>
“Thanks, but I’m much happier here. I hate
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123'></a>123</span>
dancing. It always gives me palpitation. The
lights hurt my eyes, too, in a ball-room. I’m
just as well off here.”
</p>
<p>
Billie gave a humorous groan.
</p>
<p>
“Dear me, what a delicate invalid you are,”
she laughed.
</p>
<p>
“I am getting better every day,” he admitted.
“This life of freedom is doing me a lot of good.
There is nothing really the matter with me but
constant worry and nagging, you know.”
</p>
<p>
“And that reminds me,” said the American
boy. “You will have to give up your life of freedom,
as you call it, for a day or two and go to
St. Augustine with your family. They are all
going to-morrow night.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, fizzle,” exclaimed the other. “Why can’t
Grandmamma stay in one place for a week at a
time? We came over to New York on business
and she couldn’t rest until she got here and now
she wants to go somewhere else.”
</p>
<p>
“It’s only for two days,” continued Edward
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124'></a>124</span>
l’Estrange. “They want to see the city. That’s
all.”
</p>
<p>
“I say, Edward,” said his counterpart in a
coaxing voice, “won’t you go in my place?”
</p>
<p>
“I’m afraid to. I can’t always remember to
say ‘been’ as you do and they might find out.
You see, I shall have to be with them constantly.
Now I only see them at meals and I never talk
unless some one asks me a question.”
</p>
<p>
The English Edward was silent for a few minutes.
For the first time in all his days he had
been happy. He had tasted the joy of being his
own master and of living his own life. He had
not even minded the work, although he was not
as diligent as the other boy and twice Billie had
scolded him about the appearance of the Comet
which was not in its usual spick and span order.
</p>
<p>
“Look here,” he said at last, “I’m so anxious
for another week’s happiness that I’d be willing
to do almost anything to get it. Didn’t you tell
me when you undertook this business that money
was the thing in the world you needed most?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125'></a>125</span>
</p>
<p>
“Yes,”
</p>
<p>
“Would you do it for twenty pounds? That’s
about a hundred dollars in your money.”
</p>
<p>
Edward l’Estrange thrust his hands in his
pockets and kicked the ground meditatively with
one toe.
</p>
<p>
“That seems a good deal for you to give and
a good deal for me to ask. Have you really got
that much money?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, yes; I saved it out of last year’s allowance.
I have kept it a secret. Clarence would
have borrowed it from me. He’s always in debt.
I would gladly pay it to you for going to St.
Augustine.”
</p>
<p>
“Do you advise me to accept, Miss Billie?”
</p>
<p>
“Why, yes, I do,” hesitated Billie.
</p>
<p>
“All right, then, I’ll do it. I want some money
so badly, that I would do almost anything to earn
a hundred dollars all at one time.”
</p>
<p>
Billie, who felt that she was a very responsible
party to this strange transaction, was rather uneasy
after it was settled. But she knew that Edward l’Estrange
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126'></a>126</span>
must need money very much
and it was a quick way to earn it.
</p>
<p>
“We’ll have to change places to-night,
though,” said the American boy, “because I must
go home first and see my mother if I’m to be
away for two days. Come into the boat-house
and we’ll change now.”
</p>
<p>
Billie waited for them, sitting on a bench by
the water’s edge, and pondering on the curious
situation. Overhead the stars gleamed twice as
brilliantly as they did at West Haven. The air
was full of sweet odors. A little breeze ruffled
the bosom of the lake and stirred the palm trees.
How sweet it all was! And Mr. and Mrs. Duffy,
what adorable, good-natured, fat, funny souls
they were. She smiled to herself and closed her
eyes. The next dance had begun and the music
of a waltz floated out through the open windows.
She was to have danced it with some one, but,
never mind, she would wait for the other Edward
who would now make his appearance in
the drawing-room in his real character. It was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127'></a>127</span>
a pity he was so shy. And she was afraid, too,
that he was just a little lazy.
</p>
<p>
“I believe you have this waltz with me, Miss
Campbell,” said some one close behind her.
</p>
<p>
It was the sharp voice of Clarence Paxton that
broke the peaceful stillness. Billie remembered
that she had promised him a dance early in the
evening. She had not had the spirit to refuse
with Mrs. Duffy standing at her elbow.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, yes,” she replied. “I am coming now,”
and she started down the path.
</p>
<p>
“Do wait a moment, Billie. Perhaps I won’t
see you again for several days. Won’t you say
good-bye?” called Edward l’Estrange, running
out of the boat-house.
</p>
<p>
He stopped when he saw Clarence standing
near her.
</p>
<p>
Billie felt very uncomfortable. She wished
Edward had not been so hasty, but Southern boys
take little pains to conceal their likes and dislikes.
Edward liked Billie very much and he was not at
all ashamed of it. However he was not prepared
for what was now to happen.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128'></a>128</span><a name='chIX' id='chIX'></a>CHAPTER IX.—THE BULLFROG AND THE POLLYWOG.</h2>
<p>
Billie hesitated, too embarrassed to know what
to reply.
</p>
<p>
“But——” she began, when Clarence interrupted.
</p>
<p>
“Do you know you are speaking to a lady,”
he exclaimed angrily, “and you a servant! How
dare you call her by her first name, you insolent
young upstart. Can’t you see that you have
made her very angry?”
</p>
<p>
Billie was so surprised at this unexpected attack
that she lost her voice and choked indignantly.
</p>
<p>
“He is not a servant,” she tried to say, but her
words were drowned in the abuse which Clarence
poured out on Edward.
</p>
<p>
“Go back to your boat and remember your
place hereafter. Don’t interrupt when I’m speaking
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129'></a>129</span>
to you, sir—in England servants are trained
not to answer back.”
</p>
<p>
Even in the half darkness Billie could see the
flush on Edward’s face growing deeper every
instant. He seemed to breathe in sharp little
gasps and his body trembled as if he had an ague.
</p>
<p>
“Run,” she said to Clarence, who after one
swift glance at Edward had actually turned on
his heel and started up the path. But the warning
came too late. In an instant Edward had
seized him by the collar and was shaking him
as a terrier shakes a rat. Then, without a moment’s
hesitation, he tossed him into the lake.
</p>
<p>
“You low, contemptible coward,” he said.
“Stay there until you apologize.”
</p>
<p>
Clarence floundered about in the water snorting
and coughing, and started to wade ashore.
</p>
<p>
“I’m in earnest,” said Edward. “Apologize,
or you’ll get pitched in again if you try to come
out.”
</p>
<p>
All this time Billie had been standing silently
on the bank. She could hardly blame Edward
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130'></a>130</span>
for punishing the cowardly boy who had insulted
him, but she wished with all her heart that she
had not been the cause of the quarrel.
</p>
<p>
“It’s just what I get for mixing into other
people’s affairs,” she thought. “It all came about
because I put it into the two Edwards’ heads
to change places. I do wish I hadn’t said so
much that night.”
</p>
<p>
The other Edward strolled out of the boat-house
just then with his hands in his pockets. He
was dressed in the white duck trousers and blue
serge coat his counterpart had just removed.
</p>
<p>
“You look as if you had been having a quarrel,”
he said. “What’s happened?”
</p>
<p>
“Edward, please give that fellow a good flogging,”
called Clarence from the lake where he
stood waist-deep in water. “You can do it, I
know. I found that out the other day.”
</p>
<p>
But Edward l’Estrange was in no humor to be
bothered.
</p>
<p>
“You touch me and you go where your cousin
did,” he said, feeling equal at that moment to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131'></a>131</span>
exterminating the line of Paxton-Steeles, root,
branch and stock.
</p>
<p>
“Is that old Clarence out there in the water,”
said Edward Paxton chuckling. “By Jove, but
that’s funny. You look like ‘the bullfrog on the
bank and the pollywog in the pool.’”
</p>
<p>
Billie laughed outright at this because it was
funny—Edward crouched on the bank with a
black look on his face, like an angry bullfrog, and
pollywog Clarence wading about in the water
afraid to come out!
</p>
<p>
At that moment there was a sound of shouting
and laughing and a crowd of boys and girls came
running from the piazza into the garden. They
were chasing Timothy Peppercorn, who was racing
down the path in front of the others. It was
only a child’s game they were playing, but there
are always some big children ranging anywhere
from fifteen to fifty who love to play games, and
the biggest child at Mr. Duffy’s party that night
was Mr. Duffy himself. He resembled a jolly
fat old satyr with a crowd of pretty wood
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132'></a>132</span>
nymphs around him as he ran puffing and blowing
through the palm-bordered walks.
</p>
<p>
It was Nancy, fleetest nymph of them all, who
was the first to catch Timothy by the tail of his
coat and hold him fast until the others came up,
and it was on the bank of the lake she had caught
him, not two feet from where Edward l’Estrange
was sitting embracing his knees, in moody
silence.
</p>
<p>
Just as the others came up, a row-boat shot
from round the boat-house and pulled into shore.
</p>
<p>
“Is this Marse Duffy’s res-dence?” some one
called from the boat.
</p>
<p>
Edward started. He recognized the voice of
Uncle Peter.
</p>
<p>
“Is that you, Uncle Peter?” he called. “What
is it?”
</p>
<p>
“You’s needed at home, Marse Edward.”
</p>
<p>
“All right. Pull over to the boat landing. I’ll
meet you there. Will you take back the Firefly
for me to-night?” he asked Edward Paxton.
</p>
<p>
“I’ll be glad to,” replied the other.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133'></a>133</span>
</p>
<p>
“You may expect me to-morrow morning,”
added Edward l’Estrange in a low voice. “I’ll
probably need that hundred dollars more than
ever now. Before I go will you promise to take
my place in every way until I come back?”
</p>
<p>
“I promise,” said the English boy.
</p>
<p>
He had not noticed that Clarence, seeing a
chance to escape, had now advanced within hearing
distance.
</p>
<p>
“And tell your blackguard cousin,” continued
Edward l’Estrange, “that the apology is only
postponed.”
</p>
<p>
“Edward,” said Billie, running after him as
he hastened to the boat-house, “if you want to
use the Comet to-night to get home in, you’re
welcome to it.”
</p>
<p>
“Thank you, Billie,” replied the boy, giving
her hand a warm grasp. “You don’t mind my
not calling you ‘Miss,’ do you?”
</p>
<p>
“Of course not,” said Billie. “We’re just a
boy and girl, anyway. Besides, I called you
‘Edward’ first.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134'></a>134</span>
</p>
<p>
“Good-bye, again,” he said, and was gone
down the steps before she could say a word.
</p>
<p>
Billie took another path to the house and
avoided the crowd.
</p>
<p>
In the meantime, Edward Paxton, seeing Elinor
standing apart from the group of young people,
had whispered to her.
</p>
<p>
“It’s awfully jolly to see you again. I’m not
strong on dancing but I’d like one with you, if
you don’t mind my bungling.”
</p>
<p>
Elinor looked at him in amazement.
</p>
<p>
“You seem to have been rather strong on
dancing the first part of the evening,” she said
coldly.
</p>
<p>
“Oh—er, perhaps I was,” answered the boy,
suddenly remembering that he could not speak
for his actions during the first part of the dance.
</p>
<p>
“But you will dance with me now,” he went
on, “or better still, suppose we sit on the piazza.
I have been thinking up the music for that song,”
he went on eagerly. “You remember the words
you gave me the other night:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135'></a>135</span>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“‘On&nbsp;&nbsp;thy&nbsp;&nbsp;fair&nbsp;&nbsp;bosom,&nbsp;&nbsp;silver&nbsp;&nbsp;lake,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;&nbsp;wild&nbsp;&nbsp;swan&nbsp;&nbsp;spreads&nbsp;&nbsp;his&nbsp;&nbsp;snowy&nbsp;&nbsp;sail<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And&nbsp;&nbsp;round&nbsp;&nbsp;his&nbsp;&nbsp;breast&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;ripples&nbsp;&nbsp;break,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As&nbsp;&nbsp;down&nbsp;&nbsp;he&nbsp;&nbsp;bears&nbsp;&nbsp;before&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;gale.’<br />
</p>
<p>
“You said you would like to sing it on Lake
Worth, and I’ve got the music all ready to put
down. If it’s ever published, I’ll dedicate it to
you. It goes like this,” he added, humming the
air to the song as they moved slowly off toward
the house.
</p>
<p>
“What’s that in the water?” called Nancy,
after Uncle Peter had interrupted the game and
the merry-makers had paused on the bank of the
lake to rest and cool off. Mr. Duffy, mopping
his face with his pocket handkerchief, had seated
himself on the bench occupied by Billie a few
moments before.
</p>
<p>
“It’s a man,” announced several voices. “It’s
a man standing in the water.”
</p>
<p>
“What are you doing, my friend? Cooling
your ankles?” asked Mr. Duffy, politely.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136'></a>136</span>
</p>
<p>
Seeing that he was discovered, the man waded
in.
</p>
<p>
“Why, it’s Clarence,” cried Georgiana Paxton.
</p>
<p>
“Are you quite mad? What will Grandmamma
say?” she added in an awed tone of voice.
</p>
<p>
“Mr. Duffy,” said Clarence in a voice quivering
with rage, “I have been insulted by a boatman
on your place. I thought I wouldn’t speak
of it at first because I didn’t wish to make a
scene, but since you have seen me, I must explain.”
</p>
<p>
“Dear me, dear me, dear me,” exclaimed Mr.
Duffy with great concern. “A boatman on my
place? Who could it be? I’m sorry, sir, I’m
sure. And what did he do, pray?”
</p>
<p>
“He was impertinent to a young lady and I
reprimanded him, and later when I was standing
here talking with her he came up from behind
and pushed me off the bank. He rowed off with
a man in a boat before I could come out and give
him a good flogging.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137'></a>137</span>
</p>
<p>
“Why, he must mean our Edward,” said
Nancy. “He runs the motor-boat and the Comet,
too.”
</p>
<p>
“Edward, of course. He’s a fine boy,” said
Mr. Duffy. “He often does work for Mrs. Duffy
in the garden. It’s hard to believe he would play
such a mean trick on any one. But you’d better
come into the house, Mr. Paxton, and get on
some dry things.”
</p>
<p>
“Thanks, I’ll take the motor-boat back to the
hotel. My cousins can go with the others. Ask
the young Miss Campbell,” he called after them,
“if that low fellow didn’t have the impertinence
to call her ‘Billie,’ and speak to her as familiarly
as if he were her equal?”
</p>
<p>
“He is her equal,” exclaimed Mary, indignantly.
</p>
<p>
But of course the others only knew Edward as
a very useful and capable boy who worked
around the hotel at anything he could find to do.
He had even been known to carry luggage, so
anxious was he to earn money.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138'></a>138</span><a name='chX' id='chX'></a>CHAPTER X.—THE SONG OF THE MOTOR.</h2>
<p>
Mr. and Mrs. Duffy enjoyed their own party
so much that they concluded to give another one
immediately. Accordingly at eleven o’clock the
next morning, the Comet containing the Motor
Maids and Timothy Peppercorn started off behind
the Duffy motor in which sat those two
ample souls, the master and mistress of the machine,
Miss Helen Campbell and the chauffeur.
</p>
<p>
It was a picnic party, during which they were
to visit Mr. Duffy’s orange grove and his famous
alligator farm.
</p>
<p>
As the motors passed the station, Billie saw a
group of familiar figures standing on the platform.
Mrs. Paxton-Steele, as usual, was flourishing
her gold-headed cane, this time to point
out pieces of luggage to the man and maid-servants
who traveled with her. Nearby stood Edward, Clarence
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139'></a>139</span>
and Georgiana. Billie sounded
the motor horn several times to attract the attention
of the others. Clarence looked over his
shoulder and turned around quickly without
speaking. Georgiana waved her hand and her
handkerchief both at once, and Edward flourished
his cap and looked only at Billie, who
thought regretfully:
</p>
<p>
“So, he did get back in time.”
</p>
<p>
“Strange he didn’t tell me last night he was
going away,” observed Elinor.
</p>
<p>
“I think Edward Paxton is a person of many
moods,” said Mary. “He is never the same from
one day to the next. I don’t think he is a bit like
Edward l’Estrange in character. It’s only his
face.”
</p>
<p>
“They are certainly alike in face,” put in Billie.
“I believe their nearest relatives could not tell
them apart if they were dressed alike.”
</p>
<p>
“I could,” exclaimed Elinor with conviction in
her tones. “There is such a difference in their
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140'></a>140</span>
expressions. Edward Paxton’s face is so much
more spiritual.”
</p>
<p>
Billie could not help laughing at this, and Elinor
was piqued.
</p>
<p>
“Well, I do think he is much more refined,”
she observed. “After all, Billie, it was rather
familiar of Edward l’Estrange to call you by
your first name.”
</p>
<p>
“Nonsense,” ejaculated Billie. “He’s as good
as I am, and I call him Edward. Besides, haven’t
we accepted his hospitality, ‘eaten his bread,’
as Papa says? It was quite right for him to call
me Billie if he wanted to.”
</p>
<p>
The girls were rather surprised at this little
tiff between the two friends, who were never
known to have had the shadow of a quarrel before.
Billie made up her mind that she would
tell the girls the truth about the two Edwards
that very night, even if it were not her secret.
She couldn’t bear these small misunderstandings,
though they disturbed the placid waters of their
friendship ever so little.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141'></a>141</span>
</p>
<p>
“Why is it no one ever sees Virginia?” asked
peacemaker Mary, changing the subject.
</p>
<p>
“I did see her in the corridor of the hotel not
long ago,” replied Nancy, “but when she recognized
me she flew down a side hall. Miss Campbell
wanted to ask her to luncheon with us and
tried to catch her, but she had disappeared.”
</p>
<p>
“Ever since you saved my life, Billie,” here
broke in Timothy, “I’ve been meaning to tell you
something. I’m almost certain it was Clarence
Paxton who yelled ‘sharks,’ that morning. Of
course I couldn’t testify in a court about it, because
when you are chasing around in deep
water you are not apt to examine people’s lineaments.
Anyway, it was not his face I recognized,
but his laugh. The last time he pitched
the ball he gave a jeering laugh, and that was
why I kept on swimming farther out. I had a
feeling he thought I couldn’t.”
</p>
<p>
“If it was Clarence, he was punished,” said
Nancy. “His Grandmamma beat him well with
her stick; for I saw her do it and he saw me see
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142'></a>142</span>
her and I saw that he saw that I saw her——”
she finished breathlessly, while the others
laughed and clapped their hands.
</p>
<p>
“Bravo! Bravo!” cried Timothy.
</p>
<p>
They now entered a road which was not unlike
a green tunnel. As a matter of fact, it was
a tunnel, only it had been cut through vegetation
and not through earth and rock.
</p>
<p>
“This must be the road to Miami,” observed
Billie. “You see it is cut through the jungle.
Isn’t it wonderful?”
</p>
<p>
On each side of them tropical trees had grown
in such thick profusion and were so closely interwoven
with vines and undergrowth as to form
an impenetrable wall.
</p>
<p>
“This must be a dreadful place to be lost in,”
said Timothy seriously. “There are paths that
lead through it, they say. But it is said that the
people who ventured to find them were lost themselves
and never returned.”
</p>
<p>
“Criminals have hidden there——” Mary began,
when the sound of another motor coming
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143'></a>143</span>
up behind at a tremendous rate of speed attracted
their attention from the jungle. It was a gray
racing car and as it flashed past them, Billie and
Nancy exchanged a meaning glance.
</p>
<p>
The other girls had heard the story of their
strange adventure that night at the l’Estranges,
but they had half forgotten it already, since it
was only a fight after all. However, it had been
a very real occurrence to Billie and Nancy. They
wondered if the gray car contained a man who
thought he had committed a murder; and was
that man Ignatius Donahue? Of course, there
may have been other Ignatius Donahues in the
world, but since that night, they had heard no
more from Mr. Campbell’s old friend.
</p>
<p>
Ten miles down one road and almost as many
along another flew the Comet, flashing his red
breast gloriously in the sunshine.
</p>
<p>
In the whir of his smoothly running motor
engine they could hear a song of the joy of
living.
</p>
<p>
“He’s singing this morning,” exclaimed Mary
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144'></a>144</span>
ecstatically. “He’s got a little song all his own.
Listen!”
</p>
<p>
They sat silently for a few minutes harkening
to the music of the motor machine.
</p>
<p>
“I know exactly what he’s singing,” said Elinor.
“I can distinctly hear him say:
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘God’s-in-His-Heaven-all’s-right-with-the-world<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God’s-in-His-Heaven-all’s-right-with-the-world.’”<br />
</p>
<p>
“I don’t hear him say that,” put in Nancy.
</p>
<p>
“He seems to me to be singing:
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘Begone-dull-care-begone-dull-care-begone-dull-care.’”<br />
</p>
<p>
“What do you think he’s saying, Mary?” asked
Timothy.
</p>
<p>
“Something entirely different from the others,”
replied Mary. “Here’s what his song
sounds to me like:
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘My-coursers-are-fed-with-the-lightning<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they-drink-of-the-whirlwind’s-stream.’”<br />
</p>
<p>
“This sounds like a quotation party,” laughed
Billie. “It reminds me of Friday afternoon in
the rhetoric class. It’s my turn now, I suppose,
and I’m afraid I haven’t got the Oriental imagination
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145'></a>145</span>
that will make a motor car know verses
from Shelley and Browning. All I can hear the
old Comet sing is
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘Punch-punch-punch-with-care—<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;punch-in-the-presence-of-the-passengere.’”<br />
</p>
<p>
“You’ve none of you struck it right,” said
Timothy. “This is the song of the motor and
once you catch it you never hear anything else:
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘Ketch&nbsp;&nbsp;a&nbsp;&nbsp;nigger&nbsp;&nbsp;by&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;toe,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ketch&nbsp;&nbsp;a&nbsp;&nbsp;nigger&nbsp;&nbsp;by&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;toe.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When&nbsp;&nbsp;he&nbsp;&nbsp;hollers,&nbsp;&nbsp;let&nbsp;&nbsp;’im&nbsp;&nbsp;go,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When&nbsp;&nbsp;he&nbsp;&nbsp;hollers,&nbsp;&nbsp;let&nbsp;&nbsp;’im&nbsp;&nbsp;go.’”<br />
</p>
<p>
“Timothy!” protested the two most poetic
souls of the party, Mary and Elinor. But having
got that insidious verse in their minds they could
not get it out, and for the rest of the journey they
heard the motor singing joyfully to himself:
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Ketch&nbsp;&nbsp;a&nbsp;&nbsp;nigger&nbsp;&nbsp;by&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;toe;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When&nbsp;&nbsp;he&nbsp;&nbsp;hollers,&nbsp;&nbsp;let&nbsp;&nbsp;him&nbsp;&nbsp;go.”<br />
</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146'></a>146</span></div>
<p>
Before them stretched the road like a long
white ribbon fading into the blue horizon. But
they had left the tangled wildwoods far behind
them, and were now passing orange groves
hedged in with tall fences of arbor-vitæ or bushes
of the roses of Sharon in full bloom, their white
blossoms gleaming in the sunshine like a line of
new-fallen snow.
</p>
<p>
“This must be the Duffy grove,” exclaimed
Billie. “He told me he had built a board fence
as high as the wall of China around his place,
because next to his wife, he loved his orange
trees.”
</p>
<p>
It was the Duffy grove, for the rotund gentleman
himself could now be seen frantically waving
his Panama hat and pointing toward a whitewashed
board fence, some twenty feet high, at
the top of which branched rafters like the uncovered
roof of an enormous building.
</p>
<p>
“He stretches canvas over it when the weather
is cool, and he has stoves all about inside with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147'></a>147</span>
wood fires to keep the baby oranges from catching
cold. Isn’t he a funny man?”
</p>
<p>
“In other words he has an orange asylum instead
of an orphan asylum,” put in Timothy, as
they drew up at the gate of the two-acre enclosure
wherein Mr. Duffy indulged his taste for
an ideal orange grove.
</p>
<p>
The avenue itself did not enter the enclosure
but took its unconsecrated way outside the great
white wall. Tall palms, like a row of giant sentinels,
seemed to keep guard over the secrets of
the grove; but the inquisitive vine of the yellow
jasmine had almost reached the top, and innumerable
and brilliant flowers grew at its foot.
At the end of the avenue was the Duffy lodge.
</p>
<p>
“Ladies, you must excuse these simple accommodations,”
he said as he helped them out
of the motor. “Mrs. Duffy and I like to come
here and camp out occasionally, but it’s a little
too primitive for the old woman. She prefers
Palm Beach and society. And she’s right,” he
added good-naturedly. “This is a fine place to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148'></a>148</span>
motor to, but it’s too far from people, and Mrs.
Duffy and I like people, don’t we, old lady?
Especially young people, eh? I feel like blessing
that current that carried you and Timothy
against me that day, Miss Billie.”
</p>
<p>
“We feel like blessing it, too,” said Billie.
</p>
<p>
“It was a very well-bred and respectable current,”
exclaimed Timothy. “It not only saved
our lives but it carried us into a moonlight dance
and an orange grove.”
</p>
<p>
Although the lodge was hardly the primitive
affair Mr. Duffy had described, being a well-built
and comfortable bungalow, it had only three
rooms—a large living room, a bedroom and a
kitchen.
</p>
<p>
“Take off your coats and hats, my dears,” exclaimed
Mrs. Duffy, “and put on these aprons,
because when people eat oranges in a real grove
they need protection, and I would not for worlds
have you ruin your pretty frocks.”
</p>
<p>
Thus enveloped in large white aprons, they followed
Mr. Duffy, looking like a jolly fat comic
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149'></a>149</span>
opera pastry cook in that costume, to the entrance
of the orange grove.
</p>
<p>
“Jason must have felt like this when he found
the Golden Fleece,” whispered Mary, while they
stood in a group waiting for Mr. Duffy’s man to
unlock the small door in the wall.
</p>
<p>
As for their jolly host himself, he smiled mysteriously
and beckoned them to follow.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150'></a>150</span><a name='chXI' id='chXI'></a>CHAPTER XI.—THE ORANGE GROVE.</h2>
<p>
As they passed through the door they gasped
with amazement and wonder. Nothing on the
outside of the whitewashed fence could have
given them an idea of what it concealed.
</p>
<p>
Mr. and Mrs. Duffy stood arm in arm, smiling
with proud pleasure, as rotund as their own
round oranges. It was a thing to be proud of
certainly to possess this noble grove.
</p>
<p>
Imagine rows and rows of orange trees all
exactly the same size and each cut in the shape
of a beautiful dark green ball. And, as if nature
could not be lavish enough with gifts to one of
her favorite children, each tree was a bouquet
of flowers, ripe fruit and green fruit. Through
the polished cool green leaves gleamed the brilliant
golden balls, and the clusters of white flowers
sent out a fragrance that was sweeter and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151'></a>151</span>
more delicate than the most delicious perfume
ever distilled.
</p>
<p>
“Perhaps the Garden of Eden was an orange
grove,” said Mary, pinching herself to see if this
really were a dream.
</p>
<p>
“Only this fruit is not forbidden, my sweet
child,” answered Mrs. Duffy, “and you shall
have all you can eat of it this minute. Mr. Duffy,
did you tell James to bring the knives?”
</p>
<p>
“Certainly, my dear. I couldn’t forget them
because they are in the pocket of this garment,
and I’ve been afraid of sitting on them inadvertently.”
</p>
<p>
He drew forth a number of sharp steel knives
and distributed them among the guests.
</p>
<p>
“The old woman and I will show you first how
to peel the oranges,” he said, “and then just fall
to and help yourselves. You can eat all you
want and don’t be afraid they will make you sick.
They never do. They are very much like rattlesnakes,
I think. They won’t strike you unless
you are afraid of them.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152'></a>152</span>
</p>
<p>
After a few trials they learned to reverse the
peeling on the orange and draw it down to one
end like a handle. The proper way to eat the
orange was to bite into it as if it were an apple.
</p>
<p>
They never knew how many oranges they consumed
that day. Most of them lost count after
the fourth or fifth. They even lost sight of each
other and wandered about in the beautiful grove
like a band of greedy sleep walkers.
</p>
<p>
“I declare,” exclaimed Billie at last, coming
out of her absorption long enough to squeeze
Mrs. Duffy’s plump waist and smile into her
face, “we are just a lot of butchers stabbing fruit
to death.”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t wonder you never stay here for any
length of time, Mrs. Duffy,” said Timothy Peppercorn.
“The smell of these blossoms and the
fruit have hypnotized me already. I can’t remember
who I am. I feel that I am rapidly becoming
an orange.”
</p>
<p>
“Or a mock orange, perhaps,” suggested
Nancy.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153'></a>153</span>
</p>
<p>
“No, the real thing. I’m a genuine Florida
orange, a delicious concoction of juice and
pulp——”
</p>
<p>
“Not much pulp, Timothy, my son,” interrupted
Mr. Duffy. “You must lay on a little before
you leave Florida. But what about lunch, my
dear?”
</p>
<p>
“Lunch?” gasped Miss Helen Campbell, who
had retired to a bench and was leaning back exhausted.
“How can you mention the word?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, you’ll be ready enough to eat after you
shake down a bit,” said Mr. Duffy. “We’ll see
the alligators first.”
</p>
<p>
“But, my dear,” objected Mrs. Duffy, “alligators
are such unappetizing creatures. Perhaps
Miss Campbell would prefer to lie down and rest
while you take the children to see the animals.”
</p>
<p>
“I feel as if I had been dipped in a shower
bath of orange juice,” cried Elinor, joining the
others who had gradually assembled under one
of the trees.
</p>
<p>
“Now you see why I keep these pinafores for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154'></a>154</span>
my guests,” answered Mrs. Duffy. “I wouldn’t
have you ruin your pretty frocks for the sake of
a few oranges.”
</p>
<p>
“It was worth it,” ejaculated Billie. “I haven’t
a dress I wouldn’t have sacrificed for the opportunity
of eating all the oranges I wanted to, right
off the trees.”
</p>
<p>
“I should have hated to give up my pale pink
mulle,” observed Nancy regretfully, as if she had
already laid that cherished costume on the altar
of the goddess of fruits.
</p>
<p>
After removing their juice-stained pinafores
and washing their streaming faces and hands,
they repaired to the alligator farm which was another
fad of good Mr. Duffy’s. Mrs. Duffy
loathed the creatures, however, and she and Miss
Campbell took their siesta at the bungalow in the
absence of the others.
</p>
<p>
Billie herself harbored a secret distaste for the
animals ever after that, on account of what happened
while she was feasting her eyes on their
hideous bodies.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155'></a>155</span>
</p>
<p>
The alligator farm in another part of Mr.
Duffy’s plantation appeared to have been arranged
and devised solely for the comfort and
happiness of these creatures, who disported
themselves on the banks of a small lake or wallowed
about in the shallow water like the great
lazy reptiles they were. Immense logs and great
boulders had been placed in the lake for their
amusement.
</p>
<p>
“I could easily imagine they would eat Hindoo
babies,” said Mary, watching them fearfully
through the wire netting which served to screen
her from their enormous jaws.
</p>
<p>
“Jennie is really the only vicious one in the
family now,” observed Mr. Duffy, apologetically,
pointing to an immense alligator which had
stretched its length on a log. Jennie opened her
jaws with a humorous grin as if her vicious
reputation was an amusing subject to her.
</p>
<p>
They were still laughing at her when one of
the children of the lodge-keeper ran up quite
breathlessly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156'></a>156</span>
</p>
<p>
“Miss Campbell is wanted on the telephone,”
she said.
</p>
<p>
“Me?” cried Billie. “What in the world?
There must be some mistake. Who could want
to speak to me over the telephone?”
</p>
<p>
“Best way to find out is to run and see,” replied
Mr. Duffy. “If it’s long distance, and it
probably is, they may be paying for time, remember.”
</p>
<p>
Billie hurried after the child and the other
Motor Maids followed, being as curious as she
to learn who could be telephoning her in this remote
region.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, my dear, I’m afraid the person couldn’t
wait, whoever it was,” exclaimed Miss Campbell,
meeting her young cousin at the door of the
bungalow. “I thought it was for me at first, and
I tried to take the message. There was some
confusion about it. You know I’m no good over
the telephone.”
</p>
<p>
Billie seized the receiver.
</p>
<p>
“Hello!” she cried. “This is Billie Campbell.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157'></a>157</span>
</p>
<p>
An immense distance off, a still, small, and yet
strangely familiar voice seemed to be speaking to
her out of space:
</p>
<p>
“Billie-e-e—” it said.
</p>
<p>
“Who are you?” asked the girl, with a feeling
of foreboding which an unexpected call on the
long distance telephone always causes.
</p>
<p>
“It’s Edward—Edward l’Estrange. Listen.
I must go away. Something has happened.
Make Edward Paxton keep his word. You are
the only one who knows about it. Tell Virginia
if necessary. But no one else. Everything depends
on nobody’s knowing I’m not at Palm
Beach. Tell Edward I’ll be back, and he must
represent me in every way until I come, as he
promised. You understand, don’t you? Every
way. You won’t lose faith in me, Billie, will
you?”
</p>
<p>
“No,” she replied, wondering what it all
meant.
</p>
<p>
“Good-bye.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158'></a>158</span>
</p>
<p>
“Good-bye,” she answered mechanically, feeling
that she was in some sort of strange dream.
</p>
<p>
“Wait,” called the voice that sounded so like
and still so unlike Edward’s. “Do you promise?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” replied Billie.
</p>
<p>
“Good-bye again.”
</p>
<p>
“Good-bye,” she answered, feeling very much
like giving way to a few inexplicable tears.
</p>
<p>
“Was it Edward?” burst out the bunch of
curiosity as soon as Billie had hung up the receiver.
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” said Billie, groping about in her mind
for some explanation which would explain, without
telling what Edward had really said.
</p>
<p>
“Which Edward?” asked Elinor.
</p>
<p>
“Why, the one we saw this morning. They
must be in St. Augustine, now.”
</p>
<p>
“But what did he want?” demanded all the
girls in one voice.
</p>
<p>
“He wanted to say good-bye.”
</p>
<p>
“Didn’t he send any messages?” demanded
Elinor.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159'></a>159</span>
</p>
<p>
“Just to say good-bye,” replied Billie, flushing
a little under the scrutiny of her friends.
“He’s going away.”
</p>
<p>
“Not to come back any more?”
</p>
<p>
“He’s coming back but not for a while. He
really didn’t make any explanations. He just
said he was going away.”
</p>
<p>
Mary and Nora laughed and Elinor was silent.
</p>
<p>
“I always said he was a queer boy,” observed
Mary.
</p>
<p>
“But why telephone you, child?” observed Miss
Campbell, much mystified.
</p>
<p>
“I can’t imagine,” answered Billie. “He just
seemed to have to tell some one that he was going
away. That’s all I know. He is queer,” she
admitted, laughing.
</p>
<p>
“Luncheon is served,” announced a respectful
colored woman who was in charge of the bungalow
at all times.
</p>
<p>
At one end of the vine-covered piazza a table
had been spread with a white cloth, and there the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160'></a>160</span>
hospitable mistress of the establishment served
tea and sandwiches to her guests.
</p>
<p>
During the ride back home, Billie tried to
laugh and talk with the others, and Elinor, too,
made a great effort to be gay. But Elinor could
not conceal a slight coldness which was creeping
into her heart toward her friend, and Billie, somehow,
was not happy.
</p>
<p>
What did Edward l’Estrange mean by going
away and shifting all his responsibilities on a
strange boy and his poor little sister? And why,
oh, why, would he insist on drawing her into
his troublesome affairs? She wished with all
her heart that he had not been such a nice,
interesting boy. Then it would have made no
difference if he had chosen to go to China. Only
she would have still been disappointed in him,
of course. And what had he meant by saying:
</p>
<p>
“You won’t lose faith in me, Billie?”
</p>
<p>
It was all very strange and perplexing.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161'></a>161</span><a name='chXII' id='chXII'></a>CHAPTER XII.—AN UNWISHED WISH.</h2>
<p>
Miss Helen Campbell was laid low with a
sick headache the day after the orange grove
party.
</p>
<p>
“A little too much juice of the fruit, my dear,”
she explained to Billie, who had tiptoed into
her room to see if there was anything she could
do. “But you mustn’t stay with me. I shall
be all right as soon as my head stops throbbing.
Only never show me another orange as
long as I live. Get Edward to look after you
and go for a ride in the Comet. You mustn’t
miss a moment of this beautiful visit on my
account.”
</p>
<p>
“Do you think there would be anything out
of the way in our going over to see Virginia,
Cousin Helen? She is not working here any
longer the housekeeper says, and I suppose we
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162'></a>162</span>
shall find her at home. We could take her for
a motor ride and bring her back to luncheon.”
</p>
<p>
“Certainly, child, if she will come. Ask her
brother’s opinion. He ought to know better than
any one else. But whatever you do, be sure
and be back to lunch or I shall be very uneasy.”
</p>
<p>
Billie wished to see Virginia very much. She
also wished to find Edward, and the plan of the
morning she hoped would bring both of these
things about. She felt worried, and anxious to
disburden her soul of its secret.
</p>
<p>
Her three friends had noticed at breakfast
how quiet Billie was, for her frank and honest
face had never been able to conceal any emotion
which saddened or brightened it.
</p>
<p>
“Aren’t you feeling well to-day, dear?” Mary
asked, as they hurried down the hotel walk to
look for Edward, who they had been told was
probably at the boat landing.
</p>
<p>
“Quite well,” replied Billie.
</p>
<p>
“Wilhelmina,” said Nancy sternly, “you know
something and you won’t tell. Now, get it out
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163'></a>163</span>
of your system right off, or it will be making
you ill.”
</p>
<p>
Elinor said nothing at all. It was impossible
for her to explain her feelings just then even to
herself. She was hurt with Billie for no good
reason, and she was angry and ashamed of herself
for permitting this ugly little bitterness to
enter her mind.
</p>
<p>
“Do tell us, Billie,” pleaded Nancy, whose curiosity
when with her three intimate friends was
insatiable.
</p>
<p>
“But it isn’t mine to tell,” answered Billie desperately.
</p>
<p>
“Ha! She admits she has a secret,” cried
Nancy dramatically.
</p>
<p>
“The only way for you to learn this secret,”
said Billie, cornered at last by her own confession,
“is to find it out for yourselves. I can’t tell
because I promised not to. For some reason,
which I don’t know any more than you do, it’s
very important for the secret to remain a secret,
and everything depends on its being kept a secret.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164'></a>164</span>
That’s all I can tell you, because, except for the
actual thing itself, that’s all I know.”
</p>
<p>
“Heavens, how mysterious!” cried Nancy. “I
feel I shall burst in a minute if I don’t find out.”
</p>
<p>
“I’m afraid you’ll have to burst then, you inquisitive
child,” laughed Billie, giving her a
friendly shake.
</p>
<p>
It was really something of a relief to talk
about it, even in this vague and unsatisfactory
manner.
</p>
<p>
Edward was nowhere to be seen at the boat
landing.
</p>
<p>
“Perhaps he’s in the Firefly,” suggested Mary.
</p>
<p>
The motor-boat was the last of a row of
launches moored to the landing, and as they
approached they heard a clear, boyish voice, singing:
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“On&nbsp;&nbsp;thy&nbsp;&nbsp;fair&nbsp;&nbsp;bosom,&nbsp;&nbsp;silver&nbsp;&nbsp;lake,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;&nbsp;wild&nbsp;&nbsp;swan&nbsp;&nbsp;spreads&nbsp;&nbsp;his&nbsp;&nbsp;snowy&nbsp;&nbsp;sail,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And&nbsp;&nbsp;round&nbsp;&nbsp;his&nbsp;&nbsp;breast&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;ripples&nbsp;&nbsp;break,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As&nbsp;&nbsp;down&nbsp;&nbsp;he&nbsp;&nbsp;bears&nbsp;&nbsp;before&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;gale.”<br />
</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165'></a>165</span></div>
<p>
Nancy and Mary, who were already half down
the flight of steps leading to the boats, paused
to listen. Billie also lingered on the platform,
when suddenly Elinor, who had lagged behind,
busy with her own thoughts, ran up to her friend
and seized her by the shoulders with a little low
cry that was half a laugh and half a sob.
</p>
<p>
“Billie Campbell,” she whispered, “I know
the secret. They’ve changed places. But why
did they do it?”
</p>
<p>
“For fun, at first,” replied Billie. “And now I
don’t understand. Something has happened because
Edward l’Estrange is not coming back.”
</p>
<p>
The two girls looked at each other a moment
in silence.
</p>
<p>
“You mean he’s left the other Edward to take
his place here?” Elinor whispered.
</p>
<p>
Billie nodded.
</p>
<p>
“But that isn’t fair.”
</p>
<p>
“I’m sure it is,” said Billie stoutly. “Because—because——,”
she went on lamely, “he couldn’t
do anything that wasn’t fair.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166'></a>166</span>
</p>
<p>
“But think what it will mean to him,” Elinor
persisted. “He will have plenty of money and
he can go to school and travel——”
</p>
<p>
“I know,” said Billie, “but he told me he was
coming back and I believe him.”
</p>
<p>
“And Edward Paxton, what will he be doing?
He will have to work for a living.”
</p>
<p>
“It will do him good.”
</p>
<p>
“You are not fussing, I trust,” called Mary,
who had run back up the steps to look for them.
</p>
<p>
“No, no, only arguing,” replied Elinor.
</p>
<p>
Edward Paxton now appeared, his hands in
his pockets, whistling the same air he had been
singing only a moment before. His eyes met
Elinor’s and he stopped in the middle of a bar.
This double identity was awfully mixing. He
was always forgetting that as engineer of the
boat, Firefly, he was not supposed to know about
music.
</p>
<p>
“What are your orders this morning, Miss
Campbell?” he asked, with just a suspicion of
mockery in his voice.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167'></a>167</span>
</p>
<p>
“Get the Comet, please, Edward,” she said,
flushing. “We are going to motor out to see
Virginia. Can you go with us?”
</p>
<p>
“At your service,” replied the boy, smiling
broadly.
</p>
<p>
He really seemed so happy that Billie thought,
after all, the news she had to tell him would not
be so unwelcome.
</p>
<p>
“How do you like the life?” she asked him
presently, following him to the garage, while
the other three girls returned to the hotel for
mail, motor veils and a last word to Miss Campbell.
</p>
<p>
“Wonderful,” he replied with enthusiasm. “If
I only had a piano it would be perfect. I have
just finished composing a song and I want to
try it.”
</p>
<p>
“You don’t mind the work, then?”
</p>
<p>
“Not specially. You see I don’t do very much.
I’ve got it down to the Firefly and the Comet,
and let everything else slide.”
</p>
<p>
“But——” began Billie with a tone of protest in her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168'></a>168</span>
voice. “After all,” she thought, “it
isn’t any of my business.”
</p>
<p>
“But what?” he asked.
</p>
<p>
“I have something to tell you, Edward. What
would you say if you really had to work for a
living for awhile?”
</p>
<p>
“Is that what you had to tell me?” he asked
smiling. “I should say I would rather study
music.”
</p>
<p>
“But you aren’t studying music,” said Billie.
“You’re just lying around making up pretty
tunes and neglecting the work you promised
to do. I’m afraid you can’t neglect it any
longer, Edward. You’ve got to look alive and
earn some money.”
</p>
<p>
Then Billie gave him the message she had received
over the long distance telephone.
</p>
<p>
Edward was too amazed to answer at first.
His lips formed the word “scoundrel,” but he
seemed to have no voice. At last he burst out
indignantly:
</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169'></a>169</span></div>
<p>
“And I thought I could trust him, Billie, when
I let him have that money in advance.”
</p>
<p>
“But you can. He will be back, of course.”
</p>
<p>
“What earthly reason could he have for staying
away, except to take my place? Don’t you
think it’s a good deal easier life to live with a
rich old grandmother, even if she is a scold,
than to slave down here as an engineer and a
porter and anything else that happens to come
along and take insults from people?”
</p>
<p>
“But I thought you liked it?”
</p>
<p>
“I did, but not forever. Of course, I shall
telegraph Grandmamma or Clarence at once and
let them know he is an impostor.”
</p>
<div class='figcenter' style='padding-top: 1em; padding-bottom: 1em'>

<img src="images/illus-168.jpg" alt="“No, you won’t,” cried Billie. “No, no, Edward, you couldn’t do that.”" title=""/><br />
<span class='caption'>“No, you won’t,” cried Billie. “No,<br/>no, Edward, you couldn’t do that.”</span>
</div>
<p>
“No, you won’t,” cried Billie so suddenly that
she surprised herself. “No, no, Edward, you
couldn’t do that. That wouldn’t be honest. You
gave him your promise, didn’t you, to look after
his work until he came back. I am sure you
would regret it very, very much if you didn’t.
If he had not meant to come back, he would
never have called me up on the telephone. You
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170'></a>170</span>
see, it wasn’t necessary. They expected to stay
several days, didn’t they? But he knew I was
going to be at Mr. Duffy’s lodge that afternoon,
and although he seemed in a tremendous hurry,
he called me up to ask me to give you that message.
You are to represent him,” she repeated,
“as you promised. I am sure he meant every
word he said. Please, Edward, do wait until
you get word from him. How can you distrust
any one who looks so exactly like you? It would
be like disbelieving in one’s self.”
</p>
<p>
Edward did not reply. With an angry, impatient
gesture he left her, to bring the car out
of the garage. Presently she climbed in beside
him.
</p>
<p>
“It won’t hurt you to do something for some
one else,” she went on. “I don’t want to preach,
of course, but I’d just like to ask you if you ever
have, that you can remember, really made a sacrifice
for any one?”
</p>
<p>
“I can’t say I have,” said Edward. “Perhaps
I’ve never had the opportunity.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171'></a>171</span>
</p>
<p>
“Do you remember that night when we didn’t
find the dead man, you told me you had been
afraid all your life of daylight and dark and
draughts and people and poverty? This is such
a splendid chance to show you are not afraid of
anything in the world, even of keeping your
promise, Edward.”
</p>
<p>
“But,” he exclaimed, “I have no money,
Billie.”
</p>
<p>
“Take out sailing parties and launch parties
and carry baggage and do the things Edward
did. Papa always said the proudest moment of
his life was the first time he earned five dollars.”
</p>
<p>
“By Jove, it would be rather nice,” he said
after a pause. “Grandmamma has always treated
me like an infant, you know. When she finds out
I can earn a living, perhaps she’ll have a little
more respect for me.”
</p>
<p>
“I’m sure of it,” said Billie, climbing into the
back seat as they drew up in front of the hotel.
“It’s a dangerous thing,” she said to herself as she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172'></a>172</span>
sank down upon the cushions, “to wish for a thing
unless you really want it, because if your wish
comes true, you are just as apt as not to unwish
it, and then things are in a muddle.”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173'></a>173</span><a name='chXIII' id='chXIII'></a>CHAPTER XIII.—IN THE DEEP WOODS.</h2>
<p>
Billie, having unburdened her mind, felt much
happier. The whole situation had come about
of course by her own careless words spoken in
anger, but after all she could hardly be called a
responsible party to the transaction, a phrase
which sounded very legal to her. She remembered
once her father had playfully called her “a
little accessory before the fact,” when she had
induced him to take her on a foolish excursion
that had ended in disaster. Certainly it all
sounded very much like a romantic tale, and she
did hope it would have a happy ending, but no
amount of hopefulness could keep that little
entering-wedge of anxiety from finding its way
into her mind.
</p>
<p>
“Billie, is this the road to the left?” asked
Edward Paxton, suddenly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174'></a>174</span>
</p>
<p>
Billie had just time to say she thought it was
the road, they had never been over it but once
and then at night, when Mary and Nancy
pounced upon her.
</p>
<p>
“We know the secret,” they whispered, pointing
to Edward.
</p>
<p>
“You’ve guessed,” she replied, relieved that
she was no longer burdened with a secret she
had longed to discuss with her friends. And they
did discuss it in low voices from every point of
view. It was impossible to explain Edward
l’Estrange’s mysterious telephone message. It
did look very much as though he had taken a
mean advantage, but Billie believed in him and so
did the other two girls.
</p>
<p>
So absorbed were these young people in their
whispered conversations, Edward and Elinor on
the front seat and the others on the back, that
they had not noticed that the road they had taken
was rapidly degenerating from a hard beaten
highway into a sandy trail.
</p>
<p>
The land about them had a lonely, uninhabited
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175'></a>175</span>
look. The stillness was oppressive. Almost imperceptibly,
the few sparse palm trees and
scraggy pines which stood far apart like people
on the outskirts of a crowd, began to grow more
closely together in little friendly groups. Then
the groups joined and became companies and
the companies a multitude, and the multitude a
vast legion whose branches interlocked so closely
as to form a roof over their heads.
</p>
<p>
It was hard pulling along the deep sandy ruts,
but the Comet uttered no complaints until suddenly
with a groan that was almost human, his
wheels sank hub-high in the sand and he could
go no more.
</p>
<p>
“For heaven’s sake,” cried Billie, “this can’t
be the road to Virginia’s.”
</p>
<p>
The motor had stopped whirring and the place
was as still as death.
</p>
<p>
They climbed out of the car and Edward, with
his hands in his pockets, stood looking gravely
at the half-sunken wheels.
</p>
<p>
“I’m afraid I’ve got you into a deuced lot of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176'></a>176</span>
trouble,” he exclaimed remorsefully. “I ought
to have been watching the road instead of talking.
I’m a poor chauffeur.”
</p>
<p>
Billie secretly thought he was and she wished
with all her heart that she had run the car that
morning. But chauffeurs, like professional singers,
are apt to criticise each other, and Billie had
great confidence in her powers as engineer of the
Comet.
</p>
<p>
“Now we have relieved him of our weight,
maybe he’ll pull out,” said hopeful Mary, pointing
to the motor. “Why don’t you start him up
and see?”
</p>
<p>
“Crank him up, Edward,” called Billie, jumping
into her own particular seat at the wheel.
Somehow she never could feel at home in the
other seats.
</p>
<p>
The machinery began to whir and the poor
Comet strained and tugged until his one “all-seeing
eye,” as the girls had called it, was almost
starting from its socket and his loyal engine
heart was nigh to bursting its bonds.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177'></a>177</span>
</p>
<p>
“It’s no good breaking a blood vessel, you
poor old dear,” exclaimed Billie, patting the red
cushion beside her as she stopped the motor.
“Just you wait and we’ll see if we can’t find another
way out of this hole.”
</p>
<p>
The others laughed. It was always funny to
hear their friend talk to her machine as if a
heart really did beat in his throbbing mechanism.
But after all, it wasn’t a joking matter
when they began to look about them. It seemed
as if the only thing to do was to abandon the
Comet and walk back to the main road. But
Billie was not one to give up so easily, and before
she would consent to a general retreat, her
friends knew she would try everything she could
think of to release the machine.
</p>
<p>
“I suppose we’ll have to foot it,” said Edward
with a sigh, glancing at his watch.
</p>
<p>
Billie flushed. Somehow this lazy boy irritated
her. She had been brought up by a man
who thought nothing of spanning a great chasm
with a bridge or tunneling through mountains
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178'></a>178</span>
for his railroads. There was something very
like contempt in her heart for this young man
who played tunes on the piano and thought chiefly
of his own health.
</p>
<p>
“Foot it, indeed!” she exclaimed, “and leave
the Comet here to be swallowed in quicksands?”
</p>
<p>
“But it isn’t really that, you know,” he answered.
“Besides, what can we do? We can’t
push the thing out and this sun is awfully hot.”
</p>
<p>
“You don’t mean to say you’re going to give
up without a struggle?” cried Nancy.
</p>
<p>
Even Elinor, who was Edward’s champion at
all times, was not pleased.
</p>
<p>
“If you want to watch us work, you can,”
went on Billie, making a great effort not to be
too rude.
</p>
<p>
Edward’s face fairly burned with shame.
</p>
<p>
“I—I didn’t mean that,” he answered. “Of
course, I’ll do anything you say. I was only
thinking of you.”
</p>
<p>
“He was not,” thought Billie. “He was thinking
of his own delicate constitution.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179'></a>179</span>
</p>
<p>
But she did not voice her thoughts and tried
to swallow her indignation. Never had she met
anything in trousers so utterly lacking in spirit.
</p>
<p>
Having decided to remain and see the Comet
through, the question was what would they do?
Billie sat down on the ground and began to
think.
</p>
<p>
Finally Edward approached her almost timidly
and volunteered a suggestion.
</p>
<p>
“I saw an ox cart stalled in some mud once,
in England, and they got it out with some boards
and a cross log. I think we could manage this
if we could find the boards.”
</p>
<p>
“But where can we get any boards?” asked
Elinor hopelessly.
</p>
<p>
No one could answer this difficult question, and
they were beginning to think that after all, they
would have to submit to the easiest way and
foot it back to the main road, several miles away.
</p>
<p>
“A road is obliged to lead somewhere,” said
Mary Price at last. “Else how did it happen
to be at all? Why not ‘foot it,’ as Edward calls
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180'></a>180</span>
it, down this path a bit and see what we come
to?”
</p>
<p>
Billie, already ashamed of the temper she had
just displayed for the second time in her acquaintance
with Edward, jumped up.
</p>
<p>
“Wise little Mary,” she exclaimed, “I think
that would be a splendid idea.”
</p>
<p>
“We’ll probably be eaten up by boa constrictors,”
said Nancy with a groan, “but come ahead.
They’d be just as vicious here as farther on, I
suppose.”
</p>
<p>
“And tarantulas and scorpions,” said Elinor,
following the others.
</p>
<p>
As they ran along, they noticed the trail gradually
narrowed into a path as if a wagon were
in the habit of coming to a sudden stop and
the driver got out and walked the rest of the
way.
</p>
<p>
The outskirts of the forest had been as still
as the entrance to a tomb. The interior was filled
with noises. The songs of the wild birds, the
humming of insects, all kinds of inexplicable
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181'></a>181</span>
cracklings and creakings, as if unseen things
were creeping about.
</p>
<p>
“Ugh,” exclaimed Nancy. “I’m frightened.
Please let’s go back.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, oh, oh!” shrieked Elinor, wringing her
hands.
</p>
<p>
A long green snake had wriggled across the
path almost over the toe of her shoe in its haste
to hide itself in the undergrowth.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Elinor,” said Billie, filled with remorse.
“I’m so sorry. I remember now how you loathe
snakes. Do let’s go back.”
</p>
<p>
“Haloo-o-o,” called Edward, who had run on
ahead, “you were right, Mary. Roads must lead
to something.”
</p>
<p>
Filled with curiosity, in spite of their horror
of the creeping, crawling things they felt sure
the forest was alive with, they hastened down
the path which turned abruptly to the right,
where a clearing had been made, in the middle
of which stood a little wooden shack of the most
primitive character, but still with a certain individual
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182'></a>182</span>
look as if the one who had erected it
must have put into it some of his own personality.
</p>
<p>
And why was it that this crude little hut in
the forest should have reminded Edward of an
English cottage?
</p>
<p>
The door opened straight on the ground and
from under the low overhanging roof peeped one
little window. A jasmine vine had been trained
against the wall of the house and a hedge of
acacia bushes formed a sort of peaceful barrier
between the clearing and the advancing hosts
of giant pine trees.
</p>
<p>
The door was open and they walked in boldly.
</p>
<p>
Inside were a few pieces of furniture, a cot,
an old table and a chair.
</p>
<p>
“This must be a hermit’s house,” said Edward,
who had forgotten all about himself in the excitement
and interest of the adventure.
</p>
<p>
“He must be dead or something, then,” observed
Nancy, looking about the room curiously.
“Because I can see with half an eye that no one
has lived here for some time.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183'></a>183</span>
</p>
<p>
“It’s a snug little place,” said Elinor. “It’s
almost cosy with this solid wall of green around
it. Now, who do you suppose lived here and
why did he do it?”
</p>
<p>
“He must have had some very good reason for
hiding himself in this forest,” put in Billie, “but
I hope if he is still living, he won’t begrudge us
a few planks from his dwelling, and if he’s dead
his spirit won’t rise up and haunt us for disturbing
his earthly dwelling place.”
</p>
<p>
“Look,” cried Mary, who had been standing
in the doorway.
</p>
<p>
“What is it?” demanded the others.
</p>
<p>
“I’m almost sure I saw some one. It was a
man. He stood out against the green just for
an instant. There was something white on his
head like a bandage or a handkerchief.”
</p>
<p>
“Which way?” they asked, hurrying into the
yard and scanning the green wall on all sides.
</p>
<p>
“He seemed to be over there, but I am not
sure. Perhaps I just imagined it after all.”
</p>
<p>
“Looking through the woods like this I could
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184'></a>184</span>
imagine I saw almost anything,” said Billie,
making a frame of her hands and peering into
the forest. “People and animals and things.”
</p>
<p>
Here and there a golden sunbeam, slanting
through the foliage, cast a flickering, dancing
shadow on the trunks of the trees.
</p>
<p>
“They do look like people,” said Mary thoughtfully,
gazing at the multitude of trees which
seemed to be elbowing and jostling each other
for first place. Standing aloof among them was
that slim dandy, the magnolia, his black trunk
gleaming richly, like a gentleman’s frock coat.
Next came the rusty gray trunk of the vagabond
pine which wanders like a Gypsy into all lands;
and beside him, like a good-natured comrade,
grew the palm, spreading his fan-shaped leaves
in every direction, like so many friendly hands
outstretched in welcome.
</p>
<p>
Suddenly a bird, flying quite low, came so close
to Elinor’s face that she almost fell backwards.
Perched on a corner of the roof he regarded
them with two bright beady eyes, as a singer
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185'></a>185</span>
standing behind the footlights might take stock
of his audience. Then swelling out his little
bosom and throwing back his head, he began to
sing.
</p>
<p>
“It’s Dick, the mocking bird,” whispered
Elinor. “I’m certain of it. You see, he’s almost
tame.”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186'></a>186</span><a name='chXIV' id='chXIV'></a>CHAPTER XIV.—THE MOCKING BIRD.</h2>
<p>
What a morning concert that was! It is true
it lasted only a few minutes, but it seemed to
be a medley of all the beautiful songs ever sung
by birds. Surely Dick gave them his entire
repertoire. His little quivering throat seemed
to be an instrument on which he played the long,
cool, clear notes of the wood thrush, the sweet
trills of the canary bird, arpeggios and runs,
turns, quavers and semi-quavers. Edward threw
himself on the ground in a transport of enjoyment
as he watched the throbbing little creature.
</p>
<p>
Then, with a final chirp, Dick hopped down
on the door sill, looked in with an inquiring twist
of his head, and flew away as quickly as he had
come.
</p>
<p>
“Was there ever anything to equal that?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187'></a>187</span>
cried Billie, breaking the silence which had settled
upon them during the concert.
</p>
<p>
“The darling little fellow,” exclaimed Elinor.
“Anybody would suppose he had come to make a
morning call on a sick friend and give him a
concert to cheer him up.”
</p>
<p>
“Virginia’s house must be near here, because
she told me herself Dick never went far from
home,” Mary observed.
</p>
<p>
“There’s no telling,” answered Billie. “I’ve
lost all sense of direction in this place; but I think
we’d better get to work,” she answered, glancing
at her blue enamel watch. “It’s eleven o’clock.
Edward, do you think we could knock some of
the planks off the lower part of the house without
doing much damage?”
</p>
<p>
Edward, who had been lying flat on his back
in a day dream, pulled himself together and
jumped up quickly.
</p>
<p>
“Of course,” he said apologetically, “if we can
find anything to do it with.”
</p>
<p>
“Perhaps, if the hermit built his own house,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188'></a>188</span>
he has a few tools,” said Mary. “Let’s look in
and see, at any rate.”
</p>
<p>
Sure enough, they did find an old rusty hatchet
standing in one corner of the room. The house
had been built on a slight foundation consisting
of four pine stumps about a foot high and the
space from the floor to the ground level was covered
with planking. It was these boards Billie’s
quick thought had designed to remove.
</p>
<p>
Warming to the work, Edward hammered vigorously,
but it was very difficult to release the
thick boards which had been secured with long
nails. Edward’s slim, piano-playing hands
seemed hardly strong enough for the task and
after the top nails had been loosened, the four
girls, sitting in a row beside him, each took hold
and began to pull. The rusty nails clung to the
wood with irritating obstinacy and then after all
gave way unexpectedly, as obstinate things and
people are apt to do. Over they went on their
backs in a laughing, giggling confusion of skirts
and feet, with the plank on top of them.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189'></a>189</span>
</p>
<p>
They sat up rubbing the dust from their eyes.
</p>
<p>
Then with wild shrieks they jumped to their
feet and fled in every direction, Edward with
them. There curled up under the house, his head
raised, ready to strike, was a long gray and
green snake.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, dear, oh dear!” cried Elinor, while Edward
shivered with disgust, and the other girls
pressed together with feelings of terror. How
were they not to know that hideous reptiles and
beasts were not around them everywhere in this
wild place?
</p>
<p>
But the snake, evidently much relieved that
matters were no worse, glided off in the bushes.
</p>
<p>
“I hope his wife isn’t around,” groaned Nancy.
“They always have a wife about somewhere.”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t see her,” said Edward, coming resolutely
forth and seizing the hatchet. “Shall we
get this next board off and finish the thing as
soon as possible? This is a deucedly wild place
to be in without any weapon but a rusty hatchet.”
</p>
<p>
With feelings of more or less repugnance they
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190'></a>190</span>
finally loosened the second board. Placing one
on top of the other, so that all five of the party
could lend a hand in carrying them back to the
motor, they started down the path.
</p>
<p>
“What’s that?” exclaimed Mary, looking back.
</p>
<p>
“What’s what?” they demanded in a chorus,
almost dropping the boards in their nervousness.
</p>
<p>
“Under the house.”
</p>
<p>
“Not another snake?” shrieked Elinor.
</p>
<p>
“No, no; it’s a box, I think.”
</p>
<p>
“Let’s leave it,” said Elinor. “It’s none of our
concern. Probably love letters of the hermit.”
</p>
<p>
But, strange to say, as if a will stronger than
his own impelled him, Edward shifted his end
of the board to one of the others and walked
back to the house.
</p>
<p>
“It is a box,” he called, moving the object with
his foot. “Shall I bring it along?”
</p>
<p>
The girls laid the boards on the ground to consider.
Elinor had worked up a romantic tale in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191'></a>191</span>
her head about the box which she now imparted
to her friends.
</p>
<p>
“The hermit who lived here,” she said, “was
probably disappointed in love. He built a house
in the woods and put his love letters in the corner
stone——”
</p>
<p>
“Which was a cedar post—” interrupted
Nancy.
</p>
<p>
“And when he died,” went on Elinor.
</p>
<p>
“But how do you know he is dead?” they demanded.
</p>
<p>
“If he were not dead, he’d be living there still,
like the old woman who lived on the hill,” broke
in Nancy.
</p>
<p>
The others laughed. It did not seem unkind
somehow to make a little innocent fun of the
poor, dead, imaginary hermit who lived such an
uncomfortable life for his lost love.
</p>
<p>
“If you don’t think it’s highway robbery,”
observed Billie, “bring it along. Having walked
off with two boards, why pause at boxes?”
</p>
<p>
“A deserted box under a deserted house in a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192'></a>192</span>
deserted wood should belong to the first person
who found it,” said Elinor with conviction.
</p>
<p>
The box, which turned out to be an old cigar
box with the lid tacked on, was accordingly
placed on top of the board with the hatchet, and
once more the procession started on its way.
</p>
<p>
“We look like a lot of pall bearers at a funeral,”
said Nancy breathlessly as they trudged
along.
</p>
<p>
At last they reached the Comet. It seemed an
age since they had left him wallowing in the
sand, and his one great eye, which at night glared
so gloriously, now looked at them with mild
reproach.
</p>
<p>
“The first thing to do is to find a log,” said
Edward, proceeding to look for one.
</p>
<p>
The girls were surprised at his sudden energy
when he appeared presently dragging a fallen
pine tree after him. Having got it across the
road, he chopped it to a proper length. The two
boards he placed under the hind wheels of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193'></a>193</span>
motor car, the ends being slightly raised by the
pine crossbeam.
</p>
<p>
“We’ll have to run the car backwards,” he
said, “because, of course, if we try to go on,
we’ll have to turn around eventually.”
</p>
<p>
Billie had cranked up and was already sitting
in the chauffeur’s seat. She was beginning to
see the usefulness of Edward’s plan now. Once
more the Comet struggled and groaned in his
effort to climb out of the sand pit, but without
moving an inch.
</p>
<p>
“It’ll have to be the front wheels or nothing,”
said Edward, wiping the perspiration from his
brow as he carried the two boards and the crossbeam
to the front and placed them under the
car.
</p>
<p>
This time, with a mighty strain, the Comet
rolled slowly onto the boards, went the full
length and promptly sank again into the sand.
But each time he responded promptly to the
“board treatment,” as Billie called it, and after
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194'></a>194</span>
infinite patience and energy they finally pulled
him to harder ground.
</p>
<p>
“What shall we do now?” asked Nancy.
“We’re only getting deeper into the woods.”
</p>
<p>
“We can’t turn around,” answered Billie.
“We’ll just have to ride over bush and brake,
I suppose, and follow the path.”
</p>
<p>
“Sound the horn, then,” said Elinor, “to scare
away the animals,” and as the honk, honk rang
out in the stillness the birds and beasts who
lived in the woods must have thought some terrible
new creature had come to disturb their
haunts.
</p>
<p>
It was a slow ride they took that morning
along the trail. The Comet picked his way cautiously,
crushing vegetation under his iron
wheels, like the car of Juggernaut riding over its
victims, while the Motor Maids and Edward
Paxton ducked their heads frequently to avoid
being hit with vines and branches.
</p>
<p>
Past the hermit’s house they went, past the
enclosure and still the path persevered. They
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195'></a>195</span>
could trace it far in front of them. The trail
had been carefully and deliberately made, evidently.
Trees had been felled on each side and
vines and plants torn away, and although a new
vegetation had grown up, the path was still
open.
</p>
<p>
Except for the noise made by the wheels of
the motor car as it passed over bracken and fern
and all the varied undergrowth of a great forest,
there was not a sound. The woods were deadly
quiet. The birds had stopped singing; even, the
insects ceased to buzz. The quiet was terrible.
</p>
<p>
“I feel,” whispered Mary, “as if everything in
the place was waiting for something to happen.
Do you notice there isn’t a sound? The birds
are too frightened to sing. I have heard that a
poisonous snake could hypnotize a whole forest
like this.”
</p>
<p>
No one replied to this unpleasant suggestion.
There was a long, uneasy silence. Then, suddenly,
the Comet gave a swift backward movement
like a terrified horse. Right in his path
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196'></a>196</span>
crouched a creature which might, in that shady
twilight spot, have been taken for a good-sized
cat. But his body was spotted, each spot outlined
with an uneven circle of black, and his tawny
eyes gleamed more fiercely than any cat’s eyes
ever gleamed.
</p>
<p>
“It’s a leopard!” whispered Billie, as she
backed the Comet slowly along the path.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197'></a>197</span><a name='chXV' id='chXV'></a>CHAPTER XV.—OUT OF THE WILDERNESS.</h2>
<p>
From his reputed royal ancestors, the lion and
the panther, the leopard, or jaguar, as he is called
in that region, had inherited a sinuous body,
swift as a flash in movement, and a savage, feline
face. A ray of sunlight, falling on the soft
tones of his beautiful spotted skin, gave out a
rich lustre. The smooth padded paws, under
their velvet covering, were as strong as steel.
His fierce, gray whiskers bristled at the whirring
of the motor and his ears stood up straight like
an angry cat’s.
</p>
<p>
“The horn, the horn,” whispered Mary in a
choking voice, “it will frighten him.”
</p>
<p>
Billie reached mechanically for the rubber bulb
and squeezed it again and again. The honk-honk
rang out in the forest like a cry for help,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198'></a>198</span>
and the leopard shivered where he crouched as if
this unmelodious music jarred on his nerves.
</p>
<p>
Suddenly with a flying leap, he landed in the
branches of a tree beside the motor. Billie never
knew how she had the presence of mind to start
the car. She only knew that they were going as
fast as possible on that encumbered path and that
the leopard, not counting on this swiftly moving
object, had jumped again, grazed the motor
and landed just back of them.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps it was Mary’s ear-piercing shriek
which frightened him, or perhaps it was the red
motor itself, which may have seemed to him a
newly created animal with a whirring, bristling
noise that made his nerves tingle. At any rate,
instead of terrifying them again by jumping into
the branches over their heads, he crept behind,
half cautiously, but still ready to leap at the first
opportunity.
</p>
<p>
“Keep up the horn, for heaven’s sake, and
make as much noise as you can,” cried Elinor.
“They can be frightened, I know, by loud noises.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199'></a>199</span>
</p>
<p>
Edward on his knees beside Billie, worked the
horn until his fingers ached, and the girls gave
Indian yells and hooted and yodeled until they
were exhausted.
</p>
<p>
For fully five minutes they rolled over the carpet
of pine needles along the trail and the leopard
dropped farther and farther off, until finally he
slunk into the bushes. The intervals of hooting
and calling grew longer and longer, and at last
they rested. Mary, only, kept watch, kneeling
backwards in the seat in a prayerful attitude.
</p>
<p>
“We’ll be out of this dreadful place in a moment
now,” Billie was saying, when suddenly,
there was a blood-curdling shriek. A shot rang
out in the stillness, and with a strange vibrant
noise that sounded like the echo of the base
string of a ’cello, the leopard jumped high into
the air and fell backward in the path just behind
them.
</p>
<p>
Billie, with a very white face indeed, stopped
the car and turned to see who had saved their
lives.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200'></a>200</span>
</p>
<p>
The leopard was still quivering in the death-throes
when they reached him, but it had been
a clean shot straight through his body and it
was only a moment before he lay stiff and stark
before them.
</p>
<p>
“But who killed him?” sobbed Nancy, quite
unnerved now that the danger was past.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, who?” they asked each other.
</p>
<p>
But there was no one in sight. Whoever had
done the deed had slipped quietly away without
waiting to be thanked.
</p>
<p>
“Hello,” called Edward, “come out, won’t
you?” and his voice echoed through the place and
came back to them like some one else’s.
</p>
<p>
“I wish we had some way to thank him,” said
Billie, “but as we haven’t, let’s be moving. The
sooner we get out of this wood, the better.
There’s no telling what will happen next.”
</p>
<p>
“Shall we take this beast along?” asked Edward
with a tone of disgust in his voice, that
brought to Billie’s mind a remembrance of that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201'></a>201</span>
evening, not long before, when he could not hide
his terror of death and blood.
</p>
<p>
“No, no,” put in Elinor, who had a strong
sense of justice. “His skin should belong to
the one who killed him. He isn’t our trophy.”
</p>
<p>
“I’m sure I don’t want it,” ejaculated Mary,
jumping into the car. “Do hurry and let’s be
off.”
</p>
<p>
Once more they were on their way. After a
long interval of silence, Mary continued:
</p>
<p>
“This is like an enchanted wood in a fairy
tale. It is full of goblins and elves, wicked fairies
and poisonous snakes and wild beasts.”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t mean to interrupt your poetic train
of thought,” said Nancy, “but I’m certainly
thankful at this moment that there is no smile
on the face of that dead tiger.”
</p>
<p>
They all laughed but Billie. The woods were
thinning now and the relief from the strain of
the last two hours made them light-headed.
</p>
<p>
“My beloved friends,” exclaimed Billie finally,
as the motor car slid into a real road, and the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202'></a>202</span>
great wood bristled behind them, black and ominous,
“oh my beloved friends, we are out of the
wilderness at last. And it’s no thanks to me
that we’ve all escaped alive. It was wicked,
wicked of me,” she went on, choking to keep back
her tears.
</p>
<p>
“What was wicked of you, Billie, dear?”
asked Elinor, moved at the sight of her friend’s
remorse.
</p>
<p>
“Not to have followed Edward’s advice and
walked back the other way. It was wicked and
stubborn of me. I can’t forgive myself.”
</p>
<p>
Not one of her friends had ever seen Billie
so moved as she was now. Her gray eyes were
filled with tears and her generous, finely shaped
lips quivered painfully.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Billie, dearest Billie,” they cried, standing
up and leaning over the seat while she bent
her head to hide her tears, “don’t blame yourself.
It was everybody’s fault. We agreed with
you that it was right, didn’t we?” they asked
each other.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203'></a>203</span>
</p>
<p>
“Yes, yes,” they cried, and Elinor especially
pressed her cheek to her friend’s shoulder. Billie
seemed dearer to her now than ever before, and
all the morning a little verse had been running
through her head:
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Oh,&nbsp;&nbsp;blessings&nbsp;&nbsp;on&nbsp;&nbsp;that&nbsp;&nbsp;falling&nbsp;&nbsp;out<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which&nbsp;&nbsp;all&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;more&nbsp;&nbsp;endears,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When&nbsp;&nbsp;we&nbsp;&nbsp;fall&nbsp;&nbsp;out&nbsp;&nbsp;with&nbsp;&nbsp;those&nbsp;&nbsp;we&nbsp;&nbsp;love<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And&nbsp;&nbsp;kiss&nbsp;&nbsp;again&nbsp;&nbsp;with&nbsp;&nbsp;tears.”<br />
</p>
<p>
“Don’t cry, Billie,” said Edward. “I think
we’ve had a great experience. Nobody was hurt
and we did the things we started out to do.
We’ve saved the Comet and we are on the road
to Virginia’s. Don’t you recognize this place?”
</p>
<p>
“It is the same,” replied Billie, comforted by
the reassurance of her friends and smiling away
her tears. “It’s the very road we took that
day when we came up from the lake.”
</p>
<p>
Already they could see the avenue of pines and
as they turned in, the sunlight gleamed quite
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204'></a>204</span>
cheerfully on the old white house at the far
end.
</p>
<p>
“Virginia will have to go back with us,” said
Billie, “to show us the way home.”
</p>
<p>
The place was as still as ever, when they drew
up at the front door, but a certain inexplicable
change had taken place. They could hardly tell
what it was. Perhaps, that the front door was
wide open and a big easy chair with a book and
a newspaper stood on the gallery. They had
not had time to get down, when Virginia herself
appeared at the door and welcomed them as joyfully
as if the very nicest thing in the world that
could happen to her that morning was to see
these new friends.
</p>
<p>
With a little cry of pleasure she ran out to
meet them, her fluffy blonde hair blowing about
her face like a pale gold halo.
</p>
<p>
“I am so glad to see you,” she cried. “Won’t
you come in? Have you had a nice ride?”
</p>
<p>
Nice? They exchanged glances.
</p>
<p>
“Wait until you hear about our ride, Virginia,”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205'></a>205</span>
said Elinor. “Then you can judge for yourself
how nice it was.”
</p>
<p>
Billie was wondering which of the two Edwards
Virginia thought was with them, when
the young Southern girl turned to Edward Paxton
and said in the most natural manner possible:
</p>
<p>
“I could almost have taken you for my brother
in your chauffeur’s clothes, Mr. Paxton. But
not quite.”
</p>
<p>
They stirred uneasily.
</p>
<p>
Did Virginia know that her brother had run
away? Elinor was wondering; for Elinor had
her own views on the subject of Edward’s disappearance.
</p>
<p>
Billie hardly knew what to think. She had a
bewildered feeling that Virginia perhaps knew
all about what had happened, until Edward Paxton
broke in with:
</p>
<p>
“Do you know when your brother is coming
back, Miss l’Estrange?”
</p>
<p>
Virginia opened her eyes wide.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206'></a>206</span>
</p>
<p>
“When is your grandmother coming back?”
she asked.
</p>
<p>
Edward shook his head. The young girl was
too deep for him.
</p>
<p>
“Virginia,” said Billie, “we’ve come to take
you back with us to luncheon and to stay all
night, too, if you will. I hope you can
come.”
</p>
<p>
“If Mamma can spare me, I should love to,”
she answered eagerly. “Will you come in while
I find out?”
</p>
<p>
They preferred, however, to wait outside and
the young girl flew into the house and upstairs
as lightly as a thistledown on the breeze. Presently
she was back again.
</p>
<p>
“I can go,” she cried joyfully. “Mamma is
feeling much better to-day and she would like
so much to meet you four girls. You don’t mind
waiting, do you, Mr. Paxton? I would ask you
up, too, but I’m afraid your likeness to my
brother might excite her.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207'></a>207</span>
</p>
<p>
As they followed her into the enormous empty
house, she added in a lower voice:
</p>
<p>
“Remember, Mamma knows nothing about our
working, or—or anything. Be careful what you
say.”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208'></a>208</span><a name='chXVI' id='chXVI'></a>CHAPTER XVI.—MRS. L’ESTRANGE.</h2>
<p>
The second floor of the l’Estrange house was
very different from the first. The hall at the
upper end was like a fine drawing-room. There
were rugs on the floor and opposite the door of
the front bedroom were several easy chairs and a
sewing table. The door of this room stood ajar
and Virginia led the way inside.
</p>
<p>
“Mamma,” she said softly, “I want you to
meet my four friends who are stopping at the
hotel at Palm Beach.”
</p>
<p>
The girls never forgot the picture of Mrs.
l’Estrange in her bedroom. It was all so unreal
after the empty old house. It was really a
sumptuous chamber, large, and full of polished
objects. The light came in dimly through the
heavy blue brocaded curtains at the windows
and was reflected in the mahogany secretaries
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209'></a>209</span>
and tables and the graceful rosewood lounge at
one end.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. l’Estrange was lying in an invalid’s chair
drawn up by a table on which stood a bowl of
oranges and a glass vase of flowers. She was
a small, slender woman, much like Virginia, only
more beautiful, with quantities of pale gold hair
and sad blue eyes. A ray of light falling across
her thin white face gave her a look of one of
the early saints, resigned and gentle, sorrowful
and happy, all at once.
</p>
<p>
“I am so happy to meet my little girl’s friends,”
she said, stretching out a small transparent hand
through which they could see the pink light
shining. “She has told me how kind you have
been to her.”
</p>
<p>
“But she was very kind to us, Mrs.
l’Estrange,” replied Elinor. “I don’t know what
we would have done if she had not taken us in
and given us supper one night when our launch
was wrecked in the lake.”
</p>
<p>
“Ah, but that was nothing,” continued the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210'></a>210</span>
poor, pretty invalid. “Think how many times
she has visited you at the hotel.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh——” began Billie, and broke off quickly,
for Virginia, standing back of her mother’s
chair, had put her finger to her lips, and the truth
now dawned upon the Motor Maids.
</p>
<p>
The young girl had told a brave falsehood to
her mother to explain her frequent absences from
home.
</p>
<p>
“It’s what might be called a ‘noble lie’,”
thought Billie, “but how can they keep it up?
And now there’s Edward gone off and left it all
to Virginia,” her thoughts continued, but she
stifled the notion immediately. “It’s impossible.
I believe he will come back, I do, no matter how
strange it seems.”
</p>
<p>
“I am so sorry that Edward, my son, has gone
away on a trip with some friends,” went on Mrs.
l’Estrange. “But he writes he is having such a
beautiful time, I don’t begrudge the boy a change.
It is very dull for him here. I wish you could
help me persuade him to go to college next year.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211'></a>211</span>
He should go North and see something of the
world, but he will not leave Virginia and me,
and as you see, I am quite helpless.”
</p>
<p>
She spread out her pink hands and smiled
faintly.
</p>
<p>
Presently Virginia, seeing that the girls understood,
passed into the next room to change
her dress.
</p>
<p>
They were silent after she left, hardly daring
to venture a remark until Nancy threw herself
into the breach by saying:
</p>
<p>
“What a beautiful old house this is, Mrs.
l’Estrange. It is as big as a hotel. I never saw
so many rooms in a private house.”
</p>
<p>
“I’m glad you like it, dear. It has been in
my family for a great many years and it is
rather in disrepair now. The furniture is quite
old. I have not bought any in my time except
the piano. It was all collected by my mother and
grandmother and great-grandmother, too. If
you have been in my drawing-room, perhaps you
noticed the inlaid desk. It was brought over
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212'></a>212</span>
from France nearly two hundred years ago. I
value it more than anything in the house, I think.
And if you are interested in such things, you
must ask Virginia to show you the tea set which
was once owned by Lady Hamilton. And many
other things, the silver bowl presented to my
great-grandmother by General Lafayette, and a
beautiful sword which was given to one of my
great-great uncles by General Jackson.”
</p>
<p>
So the invalid chattered away. It was evident
that the lost treasures of that house were her
greatest joy and hobby, and her children had
never had the heart to tell her they were gone,
scattered.
</p>
<p>
“Perhaps you would like to see my collection
of miniatures,” went on Mrs. l’Estrange. “They
are just inside the cabinet. Won’t you bring
them over, and I can explain them myself.”
</p>
<p>
On a shelf in the highboy they found two large
black velvet plaques on which were pinned a
dozen beautiful miniatures, some in jeweled
frames.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213'></a>213</span>
</p>
<p>
“These are all my family,” she said. “I shall
have the children done to add to the collection
as soon as I am well enough to go North. There
are no good artists in this part of the country.
This is my aunt who danced with the Prince of
Wales. She is like Virginia, I think, blonde hair
and blue eyes and the same sweet expression.
This is my uncle who was presented with the
sword. He was a brave soldier.”
</p>
<p>
“Here is some one who looks very much like
your son, Mrs. l’Estrange,” put in Billie.
</p>
<p>
The picture they were looking at was a tinted
photograph showing a handsome young man
with black hair and clear blue eyes. It resembled
Edward except that the mouth and chin
were softer and less resolute in outline. The
face indeed was more like Edward Paxton’s.
</p>
<p>
“Oh,” said Virginia’s mother, “I did not
know that was on the plaque. That is my husband’s
picture.” She laid it on the table nervously
and then picked it up again and looked
at it sadly. “My poor husband,” she said softly,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214'></a>214</span>
continuing to gaze at it so long that the girls felt
uncomfortable and embarrassed.
</p>
<p>
“Who is this?” asked Mary, pointing to another
old-fashioned photograph.
</p>
<p>
The invalid smiled as if the sight of this new
face brought up pleasant memories, and the
young man in the picture smiled back at her, a
kindly, merry smile. It was not a tinted picture
and they could only tell that he had dark hair
and eyes and a strong, rugged face.
</p>
<p>
“That,” she said sadly, “was an old and—and
dear friend—Ignatius Donahue.”
</p>
<p>
Virginia hurried into the room at this moment
and looked a quick warning at the girls. In
another instant they would have exclaimed:
“Ignatius Donahue? We travelled down in his
private car!”
</p>
<p>
“Good-bye, Mamma, dearest,” Virginia said,
taking the plaque and photographs gently but
firmly away from her mother and locking them
in the cabinet. “Mammy will take good care of
you and I shall be back to-morrow morning. If
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215'></a>215</span>
we are to get to the hotel by lunch time, we had
better be hurrying on. It’s a quarter to one now.
You won’t forget your drops at half-past, will
you, dear? And your tonic to-night? See, I’ll
put them here to remind you. Good-bye,” and
she kissed her mother twice and hurried the girls
out of the room quickly.
</p>
<p>
The old colored woman was waiting in the
hall, probably to go on duty, and Billie heard
Virginia whisper as she passed:
</p>
<p>
“She’s been looking at those pictures again,
Mammy.”
</p>
<p>
Only one thing more happened before they
left that mysterious house. Billie, who was the
last in the line of young girls to file down the
staircase, heard a door creak in the hall and
looked back. There, standing in the doorway of
one of the other rooms stood a tall, well-built
man. A long white bandage was wrapped around
and around his head. But it did not hide his
rugged face, and at that moment, his lips, for
some unknown reason, were curled into a kindly,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216'></a>216</span>
merry smile. Perhaps it was Uncle Peter who
provoked the smile, for he appeared just then
with Virginia’s battered old suit case, standing
very erect and dignified in his old blue cloth
swallowtail with its brass buttons, like the fine
old-time servant he was.
</p>
<p>
On the way back to the hotel, they told Virginia
the story of their adventures in the woods.
</p>
<p>
“Do you think it could have been Dick?” they
asked, when they reached the mocking bird part
of the history.
</p>
<p>
“Perhaps,” she answered. “He’s been off all
morning. But there are lots of other mocking
birds, you know.”
</p>
<p>
Many and varying were the emotions which
reflected themselves in Virginia’s face as she
heard of the dangers they had been through.
She almost shed tears over the attack of the
jaguar, as she called it.
</p>
<p>
“I didn’t know there were any left around
here,” she said. “They are the most dangerous,
treacherous animals in the world.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217'></a>217</span>
</p>
<p>
But when she was questioned about the house
in the woods, she pressed her lips together into
a thin line of determination and was silent for a
moment.
</p>
<p>
“Did you know there was such a house, with
a path connecting directly with your place, Virginia?”
asked Billie in her usual direct, honest
way that was sometimes embarrassing.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, yes,” answered the girl, “but the person
who lived there is—is dead now.”
</p>
<p>
“Was he a hermit?” demanded Nancy.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, something like it.”
</p>
<p>
“How interesting,” put in Elinor. “And did
you really know him?”
</p>
<p>
“I have seen him,” answered Virginia guardedly.
</p>
<p>
“He must have walked frequently between
your house and his,” said Edward, “because the
trail looks as if it had been well trod.”
</p>
<p>
“And the man who killed the panther?” asked
Billie. “Who was he, Virginia? I would like
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218'></a>218</span>
to give him something if it could be arranged.
He saved our lives.”
</p>
<p>
“He does not need anything. He would not
like a present, I’m sure, for what he did.”
</p>
<p>
“You know him, then?”
</p>
<p>
“I believe so. He is a man who has been
staying in this neighborhood for some time.”
</p>
<p>
And not another word could be got out of
Virginia. Soft, pretty little creature that she
was, it could be seen that she had a will of her
own.
</p>
<p>
They were not late to luncheon and Miss
Campbell had not been uneasy, but it seemed
strange to them to be sitting around a snowy
damask-spread table in a beautiful big dining-room,
with softly treading waiters at every hand
to do their bidding and music floating to them
from the piazza. Was it only that morning
that they had been lost in a wilderness with
poisonous snakes and wild animals about them;
or had the forest after all been enchanted and
was it all a dream?
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219'></a>219</span>
</p>
<p>
After drinking tea in the Cocoanut Grove and
listening to the concert, they strolled until dinner
time in the splendid avenue of palms. But there
was one more sensation for the Motor Maids
before bedtime. Edward sought them in the
evening, and calling Billie off from the others,
gave her a letter.
</p>
<p>
“This was in the old cigar box,” he said.
</p>
<p>
It was addressed to “Ignatius Donahue, Esq.,”
and Billie, after consulting with Elinor, added
that gentleman’s New York address under the
name, stamped it and dropped it in the mail box
at the desk.
</p>
<p>
It was impossible to fathom the mystery which
had wound itself about that name, but if a letter
had been waiting for him all this time in the wild
wood, he certainly ought to have it as soon as
possible.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220'></a>220</span><a name='chXVII' id='chXVII'></a>CHAPTER XVII.—A MORNING CALL.</h2>
<p>
One morning, a few days after the visit to
Virginia’s home, the Motor Maids and Miss
Helen Campbell received a surprise. Never was
anything more utterly unexpected than the event
which I am now about to record.
</p>
<p>
They were in their rooms preparing for an
after-breakfast dash in the Comet, when there
was a tap on Miss Helen’s door.
</p>
<p>
“See who it is,” she said to Elinor, the one
Motor Maid who knew how to fasten the little
lady’s blue veil to her satisfaction.
</p>
<p>
The knock proved to be a bellboy with a sealed
note.
</p>
<p>
“It’s addressed to Miss Helen Campbell and
the Motor Maids,” said Elinor laughing. “Some
one who knows us, evidently. Shall I open it?”
</p>
<p>
“Of course, my dear,” answered Miss Campbell, busy
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221'></a>221</span>
at the mirror with her headgear, just
as the rest of the maids came in.
</p>
<p>
Elinor tore off the end of the envelope and
took out two cards, while the others with young-girl
curiosity made haste to look over her shoulder.
</p>
<p>
On a piece of folded note paper was written:
</p>
<p>
“Introducing the Marquis di Briganza and
Lord Albert Spencer Ormond. Ignatius Donahue.”
</p>
<p>
The cards were foreign-looking square pieces
of pasteboard engraved with the names of these
noble gentlemen, one of whom was attached to
an Embassy in Washington.
</p>
<p>
“Now, what in the world?” cried Miss Campbell,
and the girls seemed quite awe-struck at
these high-sounding titles. “Why should Ignatius
Donahue send these titled persons to meet
us? We are just plain, simple Americans and I
don’t think a Marquis and a Lord would add to
our pleasure a bit. Do you, children?”
</p>
<p>
“No,” answered Billie emphatically.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222'></a>222</span>
</p>
<p>
“I shall be afraid of them, I am certain,” said
Mary.
</p>
<p>
“We shall have to put on our best clothes to
meet them, I suppose,” was Nancy’s observation;
while Elinor, holding herself very grandly,
remarked:
</p>
<p>
“I am sure, we are quite as good as they.”
</p>
<p>
“Noble princess,” laughed Billie, “of course
you are and so are we all, but don’t you think it’s
a nuisance to have to give up our morning ride
and change our dresses just to spend half an
hour with two silly foreign lords? They’ll probably
have little mustaches that are waxed and
turned up at the ends, and wear high-heeled
shoes and carry rattan canes and——”
</p>
<p>
“But the boy is waiting,” interrupted Miss
Campbell. “Shall I send word we’ll be down
presently?”
</p>
<p>
“Of course,” they answered in a chorus, and
Miss Campbell smiled to herself. After all, it
was not an every-day occurrence to have a Lord
and a Marquis pay a friendly morning call.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223'></a>223</span>
</p>
<p>
“You may tell the gentlemen we will see them
on the piazza in ten minutes, boy,” she said, commencing
to unpin her veil as she spoke.
</p>
<p>
They were much longer than ten minutes, however,
in making the proper toilets in which to
receive their distinguished guests. Miss Campbell
put on a lavender silk she usually wore in
the afternoon. Nancy insisted on wearing her
very best lingerie and a leghorn hat with a
wreath of pink roses encircling the crown.
</p>
<p>
Billie removed a linen suit only slightly wrinkled
and replaced it with a fresh one as dazzling
white as the snow that caps the Atlas Mountains.
Elinor wore a beautiful creamy organdy trimmed
with real lace, a gown that she had been saving
for Mrs. Duffy’s next party; and little Mary
attired herself in the daintiest and prettiest muslin
that that clever mother of hers had ever made.
</p>
<p>
“Shall I wear my hat or not?” asked Miss
Campbell, taking a final survey of herself in the
cheval glass. “Billie, you have lived in Europe.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224'></a>224</span>
Is it customary over there to receive visitors
at hotels in bonnets in the morning?”
</p>
<p>
“Dearest Cousin,” laughed Billie, “I never received
a visitor in my life that I can remember
except some of Papa’s friends, and I never wore
a bonnet for them. I suppose people in very high
society may do as they please. Papa told me
he saw a funny, shabby old English lady once
at a hotel who turned out to be a real duchess.
But she poured her tea into a saucer and drank
it, and when her granddaughter remonstrated
Papa heard her say in a deep bass voice: ‘My
dear child, don’t you know a Duchess may drink
tea from a tin pail if she chooses?’”
</p>
<p>
“Very good, my dear, we are American princesses
and it’s nobody’s business whether we
wear hats or not. Now, are you ready? Let
me see how all of you look first. Very charming
and lovely, my four little rosebuds. I am quite
proud of you. Am I all right?”
</p>
<p>
“Sweet as a peach,” answered Billie.
</p>
<p>
“Now, children, let me caution all of you not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225'></a>225</span>
to let two foreign noblemen make you feel ill
at ease. They are not a bit better than you are,
remember, no matter how many titled generations
they may have back of them.”
</p>
<p>
“I wonder if they live in castles,” said Nancy
with a little fluttering laugh that showed the
state of her feelings better than words could
tell.
</p>
<p>
Elinor swept along with her proud head held
high. Her friends decided that she looked the
part of a noble princess to perfection. Mary,
with a feeling of timidity, stuck close to
Miss Campbell’s side, and Billie, feeling rather
bashful herself about confronting these grand
strangers, brought up the rear of the procession.
Miss Campbell stepped resolutely into the elevator,
determined not to be frightened by two
paltry titles, and in this wise they approached
the hotel piazza, unable to disguise from themselves
that they were all feeling slightly shaky
in the region of the knee joints.
</p>
<p>
“Where are the gentlemen who sent up these
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226'></a>226</span>
cards?” Miss Campbell asked a bellboy, as she
searched the piazza which was almost empty at
this hour.
</p>
<p>
The boy took the cards and read them slowly.
Then he began an itinerary of the piazzas and
parlors calling in a loud voice:
</p>
<p>
“The Marqueese dee Brigander,—Lord Albert
Spencer Ormond.”
</p>
<p>
“Good heavens, how very embarrassing,” exclaimed
Miss Campbell. “I didn’t know the child
was going to scream the names all over the
place.”
</p>
<p>
It was indeed a conspicuous moment in the
lives of these five ladies. People scattered about
the piazzas and in the parlors began slowly to
collect near the entrance to the lobby. There
were faces at every window. Bellboys peeped
from the doorways and around corners. But no
gentlemen answering to the names of these ancient
titles responded. In truth, Miss Campbell
and her charges appeared to form a highly interesting
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227'></a>227</span>
group as they sat waiting for the noble
strangers to approach.
</p>
<p>
At last the boy returned.
</p>
<p>
“They ain’t no such persons registered at this
here hotel, ma’am. They may have come over
from one of the others. Do you remember the
boy as brought you the card?”
</p>
<p>
“I do,” answered Elinor. “He had a freckled
face and a snub nose and I think his name is
Joey.”
</p>
<p>
Joey was produced immediately. It appeared
that he had been watching the callers who had
sent up the sealed envelope, but he had not known
that it was their names being called about the
hotel. He had noticed, however, that they had
slipped into the garden with some rapidity and
no doubt they were there now, although he, Joey,
had distrusted them from the first.
</p>
<p>
“But why, Joey?” asked Miss Campbell with
some concern. “I’m sure they came very properly
introduced by our great, although still unseen
friend, Mr. Ignatius Donahue.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228'></a>228</span>
</p>
<p>
Joey could give no better reason for mistrusting
the strangers than that they seemed sly.
</p>
<p>
“I am afraid you are a person of exceedingly
poor judgment then, Joey,” answered Miss Campbell
with great dignity. “We shall see the gentlemen
in the garden. It is less conspicuous
than here. Go before and announce us.”
</p>
<p>
Following the little page, who resembled an
imp in bottle green, they went forth into the
garden, where in the distance they beheld two
figures in white flannels seated on a rustic seat
under a poinciana tree.
</p>
<p>
“They are,” whispered Nancy in an excited
voice. “The blonde one is the English
lord, I suppose, and the dark one is the marquis.”
</p>
<p>
“It may be just the other way around,” replied
Billie. “Things always turn out contrariwise
when you arrange them yourself beforehand.”
</p>
<p>
“I’m sure the blonde one is English,” repeated
Nancy with conviction, “and from the back of
his head, I should say he was quite handsome.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229'></a>229</span>
</p>
<p>
While they were whispering together as they
followed slowly after Miss Campbell, they were
amazed to behold Timothy Peppercorn running
at full speed down another walk which branched
off toward the hotel. In his haste he leaped over
a low stone bench and landed right beside the
two strangers.
</p>
<p>
“If this isn’t jolly,” they heard him cry, slapping
the blonde lord on the back. “By Jove,
but I’m glad to see you. How are you, old man?”
</p>
<p>
Suddenly Miss Campbell pressed her lips together.
Two red spots appeared on either cheek,
and she hurried as fast as her diminutive feet
could carry her toward the group of young men.
</p>
<p>
“Percival Algernon St. Clair,” she cried, shaking
the blonde lord by the shoulders. “Charlie
Clay! You young rascals, how dare you play
a practical joke on an unprotected old lady and
four helpless children? I would just like to
box your jaws well, the both of you two upstarts!
Marquis and Lord, indeed! Think of
our having wasted the morning dressing up in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230'></a>230</span>
our best clothes like this! You are a precious
pair, but I’m glad to see you,” she added, beginning
already to relent.
</p>
<p>
Her occasional mild bursts of anger were like
brief summer tempests, done almost before they
had begun.
</p>
<p>
“We are so ashamed, Miss Campbell,” answered
Percy. “We thought it would be a bully
good joke on you and the girls, but we had no
idea they were going to shout those names all
over the hotel. I got the cards from my senator-uncle
in Washington, and we used Mr. Donahue’s
name for fun. But when they began to
yell those titles we had to run. We couldn’t
face it.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, well,” said Miss Campbell, “I will forgive
you this time, but never play another practical
joke on me. You’ve no idea what a sensation
your names created in the hotel.”
</p>
<p>
There was no bad feeling on the part of the
Motor Maids. They were too glad to see their
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231'></a>231</span>
friends from West Haven to mind having been
fooled.
</p>
<p>
“I recognized you as soon as I saw your back,
Percy-Algy,” said Nancy. “Only I couldn’t think
who on earth you were.”
</p>
<p>
“Do you call that recognizing, Miss Nancy-Bell?”
laughed her friend, his handsome ruddy
face flushing deeper with the pleasure of seeing
her again.
</p>
<p>
“But how did you happen to come?” inquired
Billie.
</p>
<p>
“It was Timothy, here, who got us down,” answered
Percy. “You see we were great chums
one summer in the mountains. I didn’t know
how much I wanted to see him again until I found
he was at Palm Beach, and the Midget and I
decided we’d run down and look him over.”
</p>
<p>
“So you didn’t come to see us at all, then?”
inquired Miss Campbell.
</p>
<p>
Timothy winked slyly and grinned.
</p>
<p>
“I guess I’m a pretty good excuse, Miss Campbell,”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232'></a>232</span>
he said. “But don’t tease the lad. He
blushes too easily.”
</p>
<p>
“And Charlie came to see you, too, I suppose?”
pursued Miss Campbell, glancing at the
other boy who was at that moment engaged in
an earnest and interested conversation with Mary
Price.
</p>
<p>
“Let’s go back and get into our every-days and
take a ride in the Comet,” suggested Billie. “We
can all squeeze in just as we used to do.”
</p>
<p>
As the notion seemed agreeable, they parted
company for a time, while the ladies fled by a
side door into the hotel. And you may be sure
they were not as long in “dressing down” for
old friends as they were in dressing up for foreign
lords. It was not many minutes before
they crowded into the red motor which Edward
Paxton had brought around from the garage.
</p>
<p>
“Why, hello,” exclaimed Percy, noticing the
young chauffeur at once. “I’m awfully glad to
see you again, but I thought you were gone to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233'></a>233</span>
New York. You must have changed your mind
in a hurry to have beat us down.”
</p>
<p>
“You have made a mistake,” said Edward
stiffly. “I never saw you before.”
</p>
<p>
“Curious,” said Percy, “but you are enough
like a fellow we met on the way down to be his
twin brother.”
</p>
<p>
“Was he alone?” demanded Billie.
</p>
<p>
“He seemed to be, but why?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, nothing,” she replied, jumping into the
car with the others.
</p>
<p>
As the automobile turned down the driveway,
it met another approaching. The occupants in
it bowed politely to Miss Campbell and her party.
They were old Mrs. Paxton-Steele, her granddaughter,
Georgiana, and her grandson, Clarence.
Edward l’Estrange was not with them.
</p>

<p>
Billie and Elinor strolled together that evening
along the palm-bordered walk of the hotel.
</p>
<p>
They had grave matters to discuss and they
had slipped away from their friends to be alone.
Percy and Nancy waited eagerly on the piazza
for the first strains of the orchestra, which meant
that dancing would begin, and Mary and Charlie
lingered on a bench talking of West Haven.
</p>
<p>
“It is a queer business, Elinor,” Billie was saying.
“I do wish he had written.”
</p>
<p>
“He might have sent either you or Edward
just a line,” exclaimed the other. “How can he
think Edward is going to masquerade like this
much longer? He is really working quite hard
for a boy who has never done anything much
in his life.”
</p>
<p>
“It will do him good,” insisted Billie. “He’s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235'></a>235</span>
twice as manly as he was when we first met him.”
</p>
<p>
“But what is going to happen now? Is he to
wait until Edward l’Estrange comes back?”
</p>
<p>
“He promised to.”
</p>
<p>
“But he didn’t expect him to go beyond St.
Augustine, and he’s gone to New York.”
</p>
<p>
“The family is here. Edward Paxton could
let them know who he is at any moment if he
doesn’t trust the other Edward. Why doesn’t
he?”
</p>
<p>
Elinor was silent.
</p>
<p>
“He’s afraid, Billie, I think,” she said presently.
</p>
<p>
“That’s just it,” cried Billie. “He’s always
afraid, afraid, afraid.”
</p>
<p>
“It’s certainly queer, all of it,” answered Elinor,
when a figure which had been standing
behind a clump of palms stepped into the path.
</p>
<p>
It was Clarence Paxton, and so little did Billie
trust this treacherous cousin of her friends, that
she gladly joined Timothy Peppercorn who had
come running down the walk to find her.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236'></a>236</span>
</p>
<p>
“They are playing the barn dance, Billie,”
cried the red-headed youth, eagerly. “We had
such a jim-dandy barn dance together at the
Duffy’s, I thought we might try it again to-night.”
</p>
<p>
“‘Barkis is willin’,” answered Billie, and away
they ran like two frisky young colts.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know any of the native dances, Miss
Butler,” said Clarence, who was much more
English than his cousins, “or I would ask you
to try this—er—jig——”
</p>
<p>
“Barn dance,” prompted Elinor, who also had
no liking for Edward’s cousin.
</p>
<p>
“Will you go for a little stroll?”
</p>
<p>
“I will go as far as the hedge. Miss Campbell
does not allow us to go out of sight of the hotel
in the evening.”
</p>
<p>
Clarence thrust his hands in his pockets and
walked beside her. He had very grown-up airs,
although she had heard from his cousins that
he was only seventeen.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237'></a>237</span>
</p>
<p>
“Perhaps you think our meeting just now was
accidental,” he went on.
</p>
<p>
“I hadn’t thought of it at all,” replied Elinor.
</p>
<p>
“Please don’t be unkind to me, Miss Butler.
It was because I was in trouble that I wanted
to speak to you. I knew you would listen to me
when perhaps the other girls wouldn’t. You
were especially fond of him——”
</p>
<p>
“Fond of whom?” she interrupted.
</p>
<p>
“Why, of Edward, my cousin. Although we
did quarrel a good deal, Miss Butler, I loved
him like a brother. That’s why I’m so unhappy
now.”
</p>
<p>
“Do get to the point,” she answered impatiently.
“Has anything happened to your cousin?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes.”
</p>
<p>
“Can’t you tell me what it is? Is he ill or
hurt, or anything?”
</p>
<p>
“No, no; not that. Something much worse.”
</p>
<p>
“But what?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238'></a>238</span>
</p>
<p>
“My grandmother has disowned him; cast him
off.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh! Are you quite sure?”
</p>
<p>
“Perfectly. I was present when it happened.”
</p>
<p>
For the first time since he had joined her,
Elinor began to notice that Clarence, far from
being dejected and cast down, was in such high
spirits he could hardly conceal his joy. His
eyes had a new light in them. There was an
unusual color in his cheeks, and he smiled continually
as he flicked the foliage with a light
little cane and walked with an elastic step as if
he were going down the middle in a quadrille.
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” he went on joyfully, “I was in the room.
So was Georgiana. And we both saw the whole
thing.”
</p>
<p>
“But what brought it about? Had Edward
done anything so terrible as to be punished like
that?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, he’s been going off ever since we came
to this place. He’s been rebellious and bad tempered—and—and—”
here Clarence smiled reminiscently, “I’ve had some
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239'></a>239</span>
trouble with him myself.
Finally, in St. Augustine, Grandmamma and
he had an out and out quarrel over nothing apparently,
but they worked it up between them
until it came near being a pitched battle. They
really seemed to enjoy it, the two of them. It
was like a game of battledore and shuttlecock.
I didn’t know Edward had it in him. But Grandmamma,
she’s a Tartar when she’s scratched, and
anybody within range of that stick of hers had
better look alive. She started to strike him with
it, and he caught it and broke it into two pieces
and threw it on the floor. Then she turned on
him so calmly and quietly Georgiana and I
thought she wasn’t angry but we changed our
minds. ‘This changes every prospect you ever
had,’ she said. ‘Leave me and from this day
your future, as far as I am concerned, is altered.’”
</p>
<p>
“Good heavens,” exclaimed Elinor, her
thoughts turning to the real Edward Paxton,
who was at that moment lying on his back under
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240'></a>240</span>
the Comet, cleaning the machinery. “But don’t
you think it can be patched up? He’s only a
boy. Surely, she will take him back.”
</p>
<p>
“I’m afraid not,” answered Clarence, smiling
with secret pleasure. “I doubt it very much.
Georgiana has been on her knees to Grandmamma,
but the old General only says, ‘Don’t let
me hear you speak that name again.’”
</p>
<p>
“And what have you done for him? Anything?”
</p>
<p>
Clarence shrugged his shoulders.
</p>
<p>
“If Georgiana could do nothing, you don’t suppose
I could?”
</p>
<p>
“But think of his being in a strange country
without any money or friends? Couldn’t you
let him have some of your allowance until he
gets a start?”
</p>
<p>
“Hardly. My allowance is not sufficient for
my own wants.”
</p>
<p>
Here was a state of things, indeed. Elinor
began to wonder how Edward Paxton could ever
induce his grandmother to forgive the trick he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241'></a>241</span>
had played on her. Would she ever listen to
him? Would she even see him, no matter how
many proofs he could give her that he was the
real Edward Paxton? And where, oh where,
was Edward l’Estrange?
</p>
<p>
“Then you will be your grandmother’s heir,”
she said presently, breaking the silence which
had fallen between them.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Georgiana will have a little, I suppose,”
he replied carelessly. “But I shall have the bulk,
of course. You see Grandmamma’s second husband,
Mr. Steele, who left most of the money,
had no heirs.”
</p>
<p>
“What will you do with all those thousands,
or millions, is it?”
</p>
<p>
“A million and a half. Oh, I shall live in a
yacht a great deal. I shall have a shooting box
in Scotland and a town house in London. I don’t
care for Grandmamma’s London house. It’s old
and dingy and rather cramped. I shall get rid
of it at any price. I shall have a villa on the
Riviera, probably at Monte Carlo, and that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242'></a>242</span>
reminds me, Miss Butler,” he broke off suddenly,
looking at his watch, “you will pardon me if I
leave you, will you not? I am due at the Casino
at twenty past eight. Good evening.”
</p>
<p>
Lifting his straw hat with the affected air
of a Piccadilly dandy, he tripped down the walk
out of sight.
</p>
<p>
Elinor laughed out loud as she watched him
stepping off, flicking the palm leaves with his
rattan cane.
</p>
<p>
“And that is going to get the money!” she
ejaculated. “What a shame. I’m sure Edward
Paxton has more in him than his ridiculous cousin,
who has already commenced to gamble at
the Casino on prospects. If Edward could only
prove to his grandmother that there is something
to him!”
</p>
<p>
The young people had finished the barn dance
and were resting on the broad piazza overlooking
the lake, when Elinor found them.
</p>
<p>
“Do you suppose we could find Edward Paxton?”
she whispered to Billie. “I have a piece
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243'></a>243</span>
of very bad news for him. I will tell you about
it if we can get away.”
</p>
<p>
Billie knit her brows.
</p>
<p>
“Is it about the other Edward?” she asked.
</p>
<p>
“It certainly is. He’s been and gone and done
it!”
</p>
<p>
“Done what?”
</p>
<p>
“Got disinherited and packed off by Mrs. Paxton-Steele,
and if you can explain why he didn’t
pack himself back home, you must know a great
deal more about him than the rest of us.”
</p>
<p>
“I can’t explain it, Elinor,” replied Billie. “I
can’t even try. But I still believe he’s honest and
I’d rather wait a little longer before I pass judgment.
There may be some explanation.”
</p>
<p>
Elinor could not but admire her friend’s loyalty,
which was one of the strongest characteristics
in her fine nature.
</p>
<p>
“What a trump you are, Billie,” she said.
“You are the truest friend in the world.”
</p>
<p>
“The chauffeur wishes to speak to one of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244'></a>244</span>
ladies,” announced a bellboy. “He is at the side
entrance.”
</p>
<p>
“Elinor and I will go, Cousin Helen,” said
Billie, promptly seizing the opportunity which
had come so quickly.
</p>
<p>
Edward was waiting for them in a passage
leading to one of the side exits. He was in his
chauffeur’s suit and was singing to himself as
they approached the song he had dedicated to
Elinor: “On thy fair bosom, silver lake.”
</p>
<p>
“I came for orders for to-morrow,” he announced
cheerfully. “I have a good many engagements,
and I was afraid I would be filled
up if I didn’t see you this evening.”
</p>
<p>
“Engagements for what?” demanded Elinor.
</p>
<p>
“To make money,” he answered gaily. “I
made six dollars to-day and I expect to earn
almost twice that much to-morrow. At this rate,
I’ll be earning a real salary, soon.”
</p>
<p>
“Good,” cried Billie, clapping her hands.
</p>
<p>
“And you are really beginning to like the
work, then?” asked Elinor.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245'></a>245</span>
</p>
<p>
“Well, rather. I find machinery almost as
interesting as the piano. The climate of this
place agrees with me, too. I don’t have those
attacks of indigestion any more. My eyes are
lots stronger and I sleep seven hours a night
and eat everything in sight. But what are your
plans for to-morrow? There is a man waiting
to see me, now.”
</p>
<p>
“We are going to the Duffy’s in the Firefly
at four o’clock for a tea.”
</p>
<p>
The two girls hadn’t the heart to tell him the
unwelcome news that night.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246'></a>246</span><a name='chXIX' id='chXIX'></a>CHAPTER XIX.—A PASSAGE AT ARMS.</h2>
<p>
Mr. and Mrs. Duffy’s teas were quite different
from other people’s afternoon affairs. There
was always lots to eat for one thing; long buffet
tables piled with salads and sandwiches; great
bowls of fruit drinks and ices and cakes. There
was dancing, too, in the big parlors, and who
ever heard of dancing at a tea before?
</p>
<p>
“Young people like to dance no matter what
the hour of the day,” Mrs. Duffy had said in
explanation to Miss Campbell.
</p>
<p>
“But this is a very beautiful entertainment,
my dear,” replied Miss Campbell. “We had expected
simple tea and you are giving us an elaborate
lawn party. You must have gone to no end
of trouble, and what a good time they all seem
to be having. My girls are everywhere. Billie
is on the tennis court, and Mary is playing croquet,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_247'></a>247</span>
and Nancy is dancing, and here is Elinor
hovering over me like a guardian angel.”
</p>
<p>
“You are a careful chaperone, I see,” observed
a deep, well-trained English voice at her elbow.
</p>
<p>
Miss Campbell turned quickly. It was Mrs.
Paxton-Steele leaning heavily on her stick. Elinor
could not keep from looking at that stick
with much curiosity. Edward Paxton had told
her that the old lady had numbers of canes which
her man servant packed around in a case like
golf sticks. It would have been interesting, she
thought, to have been an unseen witness at that
famous battle when the other Edward had seized
the stick and broken it in half. She wondered if
there had been a great clap of thunder and a
flash of lightning, as there was when Siegfried
smote the staff of Wotan.
</p>
<p>
Miss Campbell turned smiling. Her manners
were always exquisite and she was not in the
least afraid of the old bird of prey, as the girls
had disrespectfully christened the war-like English
lady.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_248'></a>248</span>
</p>
<p>
“Ah, well,” she replied, “they are not my own.
That is why I must be particularly careful of
them. They are only borrowed children. One
feels especially responsible for borrowed property,
don’t you think?”
</p>
<p>
“They are all equally troublesome, my dear
lady,” returned Mrs. Paxton-Steele, “whether
they are one’s own or another’s. I assure you
that bringing my three grandchildren with me to
America was much more difficult than bringing
three packages of Bohemian glass of the most
expensive and brittle character. That is what
they are, these young people, expensive and brittle.
They have no stability—no strength.”
</p>
<p>
“With your permission, madam, I would like
to introduce my four girls to you,” put in Miss
Campbell proudly. “They are much more satisfactory
than Bohemian glass and I can rely on
them always.”
</p>
<p>
Elinor smiled to herself. The two ladies reminded
her of an old baldheaded eagle in a garden hat and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_249'></a>249</span>
a silver pheasant in a lavender bonnet.
</p>
<p>
“Perhaps if you were suddenly deprived of
your grandchildren, Madam,” went on the silver
pheasant, “you would realize how much you
really cared for them.”
</p>
<p>
The old eagle shrugged her shoulders and
flapped the brim of her garden hat with a sort
of fierce humor.
</p>
<p>
“Ah, but they are a problem, Madam, they are
a problem. People should not bring children into
the world and leave them for others to rear.
I had hoped for a peaceful old age and I find
neither peace nor rest.”
</p>
<p>
“That’s because you don’t give any yourself,”
thought Elinor. “Just leave a few of those canes
behind and things would go smoother.”
</p>
<p>
“This young woman,” continued the old eagle,
pointing to Elinor with her cane—Elinor held
up her head haughtily because she did not enjoy
being under inspection in this way—“this high-bred,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_250'></a>250</span>
proud young woman looks as if she might
have plenty of backbone.”
</p>
<p>
Elinor blushed slightly. After all, Mrs. Paxton-Steele
had a flattering way with her that
was not entirely unpleasant.
</p>
<p>
“Elinor, dear, have you met Mrs. Paxton-Steele?”
asked Miss Campbell. “This is Elinor
Butler, one of my most precious charges.”
</p>
<p>
“A very good name,” pursued the old lady.
“Butler, a fine, Irish name. Perhaps, if you will
excuse me, Madam, Mistress Elinor Butler will
be good enough to walk with me about the garden.
I do not notice that my granddaughter,
Georgiana, is paying me much attention. What
I like about you, child, is that you are not timid.
Georgiana is like a frightened hare. She rushes
under cover at the first loud noise.”
</p>
<p>
“Perhaps,” replied Elinor, feeling that it
would do no harm to live up to this high opinion
of courage, “perhaps Georgiana is afraid of
your ebony stick.”
</p>
<p>
The old lady chuckled.
</p>
<div class='figcenter' style='padding-top: 1em; padding-bottom: 1em'>

</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_251'></a>251</span></div>
<p>
“My dear Mistress Elinor Butler,” she exclaimed,
“you have quite hit the nail on the head.
That is the very test of courage I have always
been setting them, but they don’t seem to understand.
Why should they be afraid of a stick?
I’m not going to murder them. Suppose I should
threaten to strike you with this stick. What
would you do?”
</p>
<p>
“If I had the strength, I should break it in
two; if not, I should throw it as far as I could
send it.”
</p>
<p>
“And you would be quite right to do either. I
have respect only for those who stand up for
their rights. If my sticks were loaded, if they
were pistols or rifles, there might be some excuse.
They are merely harmless splinters of
wood. And yet, I assure you, not a member of
my household, either servants or grandchildren,
has ever found it out. There is no more harm
in them than there was in the Queen of Hearts
who cried, ‘Off with his head,’ every other moment
and never beheaded anyone. But I have
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_252'></a>252</span>
only to raise one of these bits of sticks and shake
it in the air and they are all at my feet. It is
very monotonous.”
</p>
<p>
“Why don’t you tell them so?” asked Elinor.
“Perhaps poor Georgiana would be happier and
so would the others, if they knew it was all a—a
bluff.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, child; that is the point. That is the test.
A coward is always a coward until he proves his
own courage, and these grandchildren of mine
are cowards, worthless, characterless cowards.
If Georgiana were only like you or your friend
who saved the young man in bathing—what’s
her name? But she is not. She is a spiritless
little creature.”
</p>
<p>
“You mean you would like her better if she
wouldn’t allow you to—to go on so?” hesitated
Elinor, hardly knowing what name to call the
old lady’s fits of rages.
</p>
<p>
“Nothing would give me greater pleasure than
to see her stand up for herself. But it is not in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_253'></a>253</span>
her. It is a pity some good red American blood
could not be injected into her veins.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh,” broke in Elinor, “but I thought you
didn’t like American girls. I once heard you
say you thought they were too bold.”
</p>
<p>
The old lady looked at her with a shrewd smile.
</p>
<p>
“I find the species improving,” she said.
</p>
<p>
While they had been idling along the path,
a bold stroke had occurred to Elinor and she now
determined to put it into action. Gently, but
firmly, she had turned her companion’s footsteps
toward the boat landing. As they took the lower
walk, she said:
</p>
<p>
“Is Edward coming back to Palm Beach?”
</p>
<p>
“I know nothing of Edward or his movements,”
replied the other sharply.
</p>
<p>
“And you don’t miss him?”
</p>
<p>
“Miss him, indeed! Lazy, piano-playing fellow!
It was his music I could forgive least
of all. It has been a curse in my family. I
am old and bent from the misery it has brought
me.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_254'></a>254</span>
</p>
<p>
“But suppose he could do other things besides
play? Couldn’t you forgive him then?”
</p>
<p>
“No, no,” answered Mrs. Paxton-Steele. “I
am tired of hearing his name. Never speak
to me of Edward again. You are a presuming,
impudent young upstart.”
</p>
<p>
“And you,” exclaimed Elinor, flushing scarlet,
“and you, Mrs. Paxton-Steele, are a cruel, vain
old woman. You think you are wise and you
are only stupid. Because it is stupid to be a bully.
You are crushing all the soul and spirit out of
Edward and Georgiana until, instead of loving
you, they—they hate you,” she ended, stamping
her foot on the gravel path.
</p>
<p>
“What? What?” screamed the old woman,
choking with rage.
</p>
<p>
She raised her stick. But before she could
lay it across Elinor’s back the young girl seized
it with both hands, wrenched it from her and
pitched it into the lake. Then she burst into
tears.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Paxton-Steele sat down on a bench and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_255'></a>255</span>
folded her hands in her lap. “Don’t cry, child,”
she said as calmly as if a moment before a tornado
of rage had not almost swept both of them
off their feet. “But of course all women must
cry,” she added. “I was curious to see if you
would keep your word, which I am delighted to
see you did. I shall have no sticks left if this
keeps up. Dear, dear, dear!”
</p>
<p>
“But you had no right to experiment with me
like that,” sobbed Elinor. “I’m not one of your
unfortunate grandchildren.”
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Paxton-Steele laughed good-humoredly.
</p>
<p>
“I haven’t enjoyed myself so much in years,”
she said. “It’s a dangerous thing, my dear, for
a rich old woman to be bored and disappointed,
that is, if she has a bundle of sticks nearby. But
of course I had no intention of striking you, just
now. I should have had the whole Duffy clan
on my back in a moment if I had, and your little
peacock chaperone in the bargain. It was only
an experiment, as you say. So I am a vain, cruel,
stupid bully, am I?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_256'></a>256</span>
</p>
<p>
Elinor hung her head. She was ashamed of
her outbreak now that calm was restored. She
felt that Mrs. Paxton-Steele was really just a
big tease; that her grandchildren had never understood
her and perhaps—perhaps. A notion
had come into Elinor’s head. Might it not be
that she was too deep for any of them to fathom?
For just one instant Elinor had caught a glimpse
into this strange woman’s mind, and now she was
more than ever bent on the original object of the
walk which had taken its course downward toward
the water’s edge.
</p>
<p>
“Why didn’t you add that I was an old cat
playing with a harmless little mouse?” her eccentric
companion added leaning on the young
girl’s shoulder almost affectionately.
</p>
<p>
“Because I didn’t feel like a helpless mouse,”
returned Elinor, dabbing her eyes with her
pocket handkerchief to remove the last traces
of tears from them.
</p>
<p>
“But where are you bound for now, Elinor
Butler?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_257'></a>257</span>
</p>
<p>
“Wouldn’t you like to take a motor-boat ride?
We have a splendid engineer. He is reliable
and knows the engine thoroughly.”
</p>
<p>
“I should like it very much. It would cool our
blood after our recent passage at arms.”

<p>
Edward Paxton, with nothing special to do,
was lying on one of the cushioned seats of the
Firefly, humming his favorite tune. Mechanically
he felt in his pockets for a roll of bills.
</p>
<p>
“All earned,” he said softly, smiling into the
deep blue sky with an expression of ineffable
content. “Pretty good for a new hand,” he
added, listening with pleasure to the quiet music
of the waves lapping the sides of the boat.
</p>
<p>
He drew the money from his pocket and began
to count it.
</p>
<p>
“I beg your pardon,” said a voice just over
him.
</p>
<p>
Edward looked up quickly. It was his cousin,
Clarence, flicking at his duck trousers with his
everlasting rattan cane. “By Jove,” added Clarence
with a somewhat startled expression on his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_259'></a>259</span>
face, “by Jupiter, but you resemble my cousin
Edward! Georgiana told me, but I didn’t altogether
believe her. I’ve really never seen your
face well by daylight before, you know.”
</p>
<p>
Edward did not trust himself to reply.
</p>
<p>
“I came down here,” Clarence went on, “to
make you an humble apology. It was awfully
nasty of me, you know, that day to have spoken
as I did. I hope it’s all over and forgotten now,
old man. Isn’t it?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” said Edward, thrusting his hands in
his pockets and turning his face toward the lake.
</p>
<p>
“How is business at present? Pretty good?”
went on Clarence in his most ingratiating tone,
climbing into the boat without being asked and
sitting down beside Edward.
</p>
<p>
“Pretty good.”
</p>
<p>
“I imagine you earn quite a good deal now,
don’t you, taking out parties every day? And
I notice you are working on the motor cars at
night, too.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_260'></a>260</span>
</p>
<p>
Edward shrugged his shoulders. He was not
surprised at what was coming next.
</p>
<p>
“I had a beastly stroke of luck last night, old
man. I went over to the Casino with some fellows
and lost more than I happened to have on
hand just now. What do you say to lending me
a small sum at a high rate of interest?”
</p>
<p>
“Why don’t you borrow from your cousin?”
asked Edward.
</p>
<p>
“By Jove—but of course you haven’t heard
the news, old man, have you, not having any way
to hear it. Edward’s played the deuce with my
old Grandmamma and she’s disinherited him.
Sent him packing, bag and baggage, don’t you
know.”
</p>
<p>
“What——” the engineer began and then
turned his face away to hide his expression of
amazement, horror, and alas, fear.
</p>
<p>
“I’m the only heir, now, don’t you know. Of
course, Georgiana counts for nothing. I’m the
old lady’s favorite grandchild and I shall be as
rich as Croesus, I tell you. You can safely lend
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_261'></a>261</span>
me any amount. I’ll pay you back twice over.
Grandmamma can’t last much longer now.
She’ll go off with apoplexy in one of her fits of
rage. She’s bound to, don’t you know. She’ll
not last a year.”
</p>
<p>
Edward’s shoulders suddenly began to shake
with irrepressible laughter, not at the thought
of the ending Clarence had pictured for his unfortunate
grandmother, but at Clarence’s unexampled
assurance.
</p>
<p>
“It is something of a joke, old man, isn’t it?
But about that money, you know,” he was beginning,
while he drew a package of cigarettes
from his pocket, offered one to Edward which
was refused, and lit another himself. “By Jupiter,
if here isn’t the old woman herself,” he exclaimed
laying the cigarette down on the seat.
“Were you looking for me, Grandmamma?” he
asked, jumping off and removing his hat with a
flourish.
</p>
<p>
“No, I’m not looking for you. I’m looking for
a boat with a first-class, reliable engineer in it,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_262'></a>262</span>
who will take me out on the lake without upsetting
me into the water.”
</p>
<p>
“Here is the one, Mrs. Paxton-Steele,” said
Elinor, trying not to smile, as she helped the
old lady into the Firefly with Clarence’s assistance.
“This is the boat and the engineer both.
Will you take us for a little ride, Edward?” she
asked, giving the boy a meaning glance.
</p>
<p>
“Let me out first,” demanded Clarence, who
had no mind to go boat riding that afternoon
with his aged relative.
</p>
<p>
“No such thing,” snapped his grandmother.
“Stay where you are. You know how to run a
motor-boat and if one engineer fails, we shall
have another at hand. Stay where you are, but
don’t talk. I want to hear Mistress Elinor Butler
talk about her home in America, and what
methods her parents used to rear her into such
a fine, spirited young woman, who is not afraid
to speak out when she wants to.”
</p>
<p>
Elinor blushed. She had planned other things
for this boat ride and this incorrigible old eagle
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_263'></a>263</span>
was upsetting all her schemes. Both grandsons
looked up with interest. Never had they heard
their grandmother speak in this way before.
</p>
<p>
Edward started the boat and presently they
were sailing smoothly over the pleasant waters
of Lake Worth. Mrs. Paxton-Steele, who was
enjoying the ride extremely, had hardly noticed
the engineer who had pulled his cap well down
over his eyes and bent over the engine. Clarence,
bored to extinction, looked sullenly toward shore,
and took furtive puffs from his cigarette which
was concealed between times on the seat beside
him. The English lady had become reminiscent.
She was telling Elinor a really thrilling story of
a shipwreck in which she had nearly lost her
life some fifty years before. Elinor remembered
afterwards that she had an indescribable feeling
of waiting for something. As the tropical shores
receded and the striped awnings on the lawn of
the Duffy villa became spots of white, she exchanged
a long glance with Edward, who smiled
slightly and began whistling softly the air he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_264'></a>264</span>
had composed to “The white swan spread his
snowy sail.”
</p>
<p>
After all, life was an exceedingly pleasant
thing to a perfectly able-bodied and quite talented
young man, even if he were disinherited by an
irascible old grandparent.
</p>
<p>
“It all proved to me,” finished Mrs. Paxton-Steele,
“that courage—” (Clarence laid down his
cigarette and began to listen and Edward turned
his face toward her) “real courage, is the most
admirable trait of character that——”
</p>
<p>
One of those inexplicable little puffs of wind
which people who sail in boats on a lake must
learn to expect, gave the old lady’s hat brim an
impudent flop, tossed Edward’s cap to the other
end of the boat, and blew Clarence’s cigarette
dangerously near the gasoline tank. But this
same frolicsome breeze was the means of saving
two lives. Both boys rose at the same moment
and moved to the other end of the boat,
one to get his cap and the other his cigarette
which he thought had blown that way.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_265'></a>265</span>
</p>
<p>
The next instant there was a loud explosion.
The boat was shaken as a leaf in the wind, then
with a convulsive shiver lay still in the water,
like a creature stricken to death. A puff of
smoke followed the noise and after that a tongue
of flame shot high into the air and began licking
its way hungrily along the seat.
</p>
<p>
Elinor found herself lying across Mrs. Paxton-Steele’s
lap and the two boys were flat in
the bottom of the boat. The old lady’s face had
turned a deep purplish red and she sat looking
at the flames with a strange, stupid expression.
</p>
<p>
Then up jumped Clarence, gave one look at
his grandmother, another at the burning boat,
and leaped into the water. With long, even
strokes he made for the shore. As his grandmother
watched him, a light came into her eyes
and she tried to speak, but she could only mutter
in a thick unnatural voice:
</p>
<p>
“Cow-ad-cowad-cowad!”
</p>
<p>
In the meantime Elinor was throwing water
into Edward’s face. He had been stunned by
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_266'></a>266</span>
the explosion but consciousness came back to him
with the first dash of cold spray on his cheeks,
and he sat up. Perhaps, in his dazed condition,
he had forgotten that his grandmother and Elinor
were in the burning boat and only saw the
flames leaping high into the air. At any rate,
without looking behind him, he jumped to the
seat, stood for an instant poised on the side of
the boat, and dived into the water as his cousin
had done. When he rose again to the top and
started to strike out toward shore, he glanced
back over his shoulder. What he saw was his
grandmother’s countenance, still that strange
purplish color, and Elinor sitting beside her,
holding her hand with a very haughty, proud
expression on her face.
</p>
<p>
With three strokes he was at the side of the
boat.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, what have I done?” he cried as he drew
himself on board again.
</p>
<p>
It all happened very quickly, and Clarence
was still hardly twenty yards from them, when
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_267'></a>267</span>
Edward, kneeling in the bottom of the launch,
drew out the fire extinguishers.
</p>
<p>
“It’s the gasoline that’s burning now,” he said
in a quiet, steady voice. “If we can only put
that out we’re all right.”
</p>
<p>
Wrenching the cap off the top of the torpedo
shaped object, he rushed to the burning end of
the boat and poured it over the flames. There
were only two extinguishers, however, and the
fire still continued to lick its way along the cushions
after all the fluid had been used.
</p>
<p>
Elinor drew out a striped Roman blanket that
Miss Campbell was in the habit of using to keep
her knees warm when sailing, and thrust it into
his hands.
</p>
<p>
They dipped it into the lake and throwing it
over the obstinate little flames which still remained,
extinguished them completely.
</p>
<p>
“It’s all out,” announced Edward, looking quite
old and grizzled with his eyebrows and front hair
burned to an ashen gray.
</p>
<p>
“I’m afraid your grandmother has had a bad
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_268'></a>268</span>
shock, Edward,” said Elinor. “We must get her
to shore as quickly as possible.”
</p>
<p>
“Grandmamma, dear grandmamma,” he exclaimed,
kneeling beside her with a sudden impulse
of affection which he would have lavished
on her long before with a little encouragement.
</p>
<p>
The poor old woman lifted one hand heavily
and put it on his head.
</p>
<p>
“Brase-boy sedward-my granson,” she tried to
say.
</p>
<p>
“There comes the other launch,” cried Elinor
as a boat shot out from shore. And it did not
reach them any too soon, for the Firefly had a
hole pierced in her side and was already fast
filling with water.
</p>
<p>
It was not an easy matter to transfer Mrs.
Paxton-Steele from one boat to the other, but it
was finally accomplished, and towing the stricken
Firefly after them, they made for the shore.
</p>
<p>
Nobody had remembered Clarence until they
heard him hail loudly. He was evidently very
tired and had been resting on his back when they
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_269'></a>269</span>
reached him. But he clambered in and plucked
up breath sufficient to say:
</p>
<p>
“I had hoped to get to land and bring a boat
back myself, grandmamma.”
</p>
<p>
“Cowad-an-liar,” she mumbled and closed her
eyes.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_270'></a>270</span><a name='chXXI' id='chXXI'></a>CHAPTER XXI.—PICNICKING UNDER THE PINES.</h2>
<p>
“We are very much like murderers returning
to the scene of their crime,” observed Mary
Price as she followed her friends along a sandy
trail which led to the forest. “Suppose the mate
of the dead leopard should be lurking about
somewhere?”
</p>
<p>
“And suppose the moccasin we didn’t kill
should return with self, wife and numerous family,”
added Nancy.
</p>
<p>
“Don’t suppose so many dreadful things,” objected
Billie. “The moccasin isn’t going to come
out here in these open spaces, and as for Mrs.
Leopard, Charlie will kill her with his borrowed
rifle if she comes snooping about.”
</p>
<p>
Ever since that eventful day when the Comet
had been stalled in a sand bank, Billie and her
friends had wished to return to the pine forest
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_271'></a>271</span>
for a picnic. Leaving the Comet among those
vanguard trees which lingered on the outskirts
of the woods, before the trail became too soft,
they carried their luncheon somewhat within the
confines of the pine woods and chose for their
picnicking ground an open space carpeted with
pine needles. Here the trees grew to immense
heights before they put forth their crown of
fringy foliage.
</p>
<p>
Miss Campbell, off on a motor trip with the
Duffys that morning, had trusted her young
charges to their old West Haven friends, Percy
and Charlie. They had invited Timothy Peppercorn
to come, and Edward Paxton, who was
growing more and more in favor with the Motor
Maids every day.
</p>
<p>
Two days had passed since the explosion of
the gasoline on the Firefly and the old eagle, his
grandmother, who had suffered a slight stroke,
had not asked for him again. Georgiana was
at her side, but Clarence, she had ordered to
keep out of her sight.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_272'></a>272</span>
</p>
<p>
“The girls are not to do any work to-day,”
announced Percy gallantly. “Be seated, ladies,
while we become your slaves.”
</p>
<p>
“But you don’t know how,” exclaimed Billie.
“You haven’t been trained in the business as we
have.”
</p>
<p>
“Just you wait and watch,” returned Percy.
“Charlie, you build the fire while we prepare
the victuals.”
</p>
<p>
“What an unappetizing word,” ejaculated Elinor,
sniffing. “Why not viands?”
</p>
<p>
“The first course will be viands, then,” said
Percy, proceeding to peel the bark from a long,
straight althea twig, while Charlie with a knife
and tablespoon dug a circular trench to keep the
flames from spreading, swept the pine needles
into the centre, and built a beautiful fire of pine
logs and branches.
</p>
<p>
Presently it burned down to a bed of very hot
cinders, on each side of which he planted two
stout sticks with forked ends.
</p>
<p>
“What on earth are you doing with those long
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_273'></a>273</span>
gumbo shooters, Charlie?” called Billie, fidgeting
from the inactivity of being served by four
slaves.
</p>
<p>
“Something perfectly ripping,” he answered.
“Wait until you taste what’s to come, and see.”
</p>
<p>
“This will be a course of viands, good strong
food, I can tell you,” added Percy, very busy
over the luncheon hamper.
</p>
<p>
“We don’t like the looks of it now,” said
Nancy. “Fortunately, there are cakes and sandwiches
in the basket for those who can’t quite
go strong food, as you call it.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, this is our contribution to the party beside
our services, and I’ll wager a pound of
candy apiece that after the cooking process you’ll
eat every scrap, even the onions.”
</p>
<p>
“Ugh!” shuddered Elinor.
</p>
<p>
In the meantime Edward had opened a bundle
containing a large juicy beefsteak which he cut
into small round pieces. Percy was engaged in
peeling and slicing potatoes and Timothy was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_274'></a>274</span>
putting half a dozen Bermuda onions through
the same process.
</p>
<p>
“Ready, mates?” called Percy.
</p>
<p>
“Aye, aye, sir,” answered the others. And
with that they began spearing slices of the meat
and vegetables on a long stick and between every
potato slice and section of beefsteak, they sandwiched
a slice of bacon, then came another piece
of potato, then a slice of onion and then the
beefsteak again.
</p>
<p>
“Now for the salt and pepper, gentlemen.
Build up the fire a little, Charlie. Swing him
over. Who says we are not cooks?”
</p>
<p>
Resting neatly in the crotchet of the two upright
sticks, this unusual arrangement of meat
and vegetables began sending out a sizzling, appetizing
odor while the four cooks danced a wild
Indian war dance around the fire.
</p>
<p>
“Dear me, it does smell good,” admitted Billie
at last. “I’m beginning to think I may lose that
pound of candy, Percy.”
</p>
<p>
“Spread the cloth, Charlie, dear,” called Percy
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_275'></a>275</span>
in a high woman’s voice which always made them
laugh. “Lady Elinor may make the tea now,
and Miss Nancy-Bell may cut the cake. I’m
head chef of this kitchen. That’s the reason I
give so many orders. Timothy, suppose you entertain
the guests with one of your stunts while
the beefsteak is cooking.”
</p>
<p>
“Do ‘The Battle of Marathon,’ Timothy,” ordered
Billie.
</p>
<p>
Timothy rose obediently and made a bashful
bow.
</p>
<p>
“I’m supposed to be a little schoolgirl,” he
said, “ridiculous as that may seem, and the
teacher has commanded me to tell the story of
the Battle of Marathon. This is the history
class.
</p>
<p>
“The Ba-el of Marathon,” he began, in an absurd
little girl’s voice, “the Ba-el of Marathon
was a great ba-el. It happened in Greeth yearth
and yearth ago. There were two sidths to the
ba-el and they fo’t and fo’t and fo’t and ever tho
many pe-pel wath killed and at lath the thide
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_276'></a>276</span>
that had the moth men killed wath beaten an’
the other thide won, an’ that wath the end. I
forget which wath the thide that won.”
</p>
<p>
A joyous laugh went up at this lucid and
graphic account of the famous battle. But deeper
and merrier was the laugh which mingled with
it. The young people suddenly became aware
that a stranger had joined their circle and was
now leaning against a pine tree looking at the
picnic party with an expression of intense amusement.
He was a handsome man, rather past
middle age, of medium height with a fine rugged
face, bronzed with sun and wind, and quizzical,
laughing, gray-blue eyes. He wore khaki trousers
much the worse for wear. His rather large
head with its iron-gray hair, slightly thin at the
temples, was uncovered, and across the forehead
was the red mark of a recent bruise or scar. He
carried a rifle under one arm and a fishing rod
under the other.
</p>
<p>
“I beg your pardon, young ladies,” he said.
“I didn’t mean to intrude, but I was attracted by
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_277'></a>277</span>
the appetizing fumes of your beefsteak and
bacon. Not many visitors at Palm Beach are
fond of Gypsy picnics like this. I was curious
to see whom it could be.”
</p>
<p>
They knew, all of them, at once, that it was
not a tramp who was speaking, in spite of his
shabby old trousers and his collarless shirt.
</p>
<p>
Then Billie, looking at his face closely again,
and the beautiful smile which now radiated it,
rose rather shyly and said, somewhat to the surprise
of her friends—
</p>
<p>
“Won’t you join us? We’ve brought lots of
lunch, and I’m sure there is enough of Percy’s
burgoo, or whatever it is, to feed a regiment.”
</p>
<p>
The stranger hesitated a moment, looking at
the others.
</p>
<p>
“Do please,” echoed Nancy, always following
the lead of Captain Billie.
</p>
<p>
“I hope you will,” added Percy, cordially, never
behind in dispensing hospitality.
</p>
<p>
“I accept your invitation with pleasure,” replied the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_278'></a>278</span>
stranger. “It’s most kind of you, I am
sure. I’m hungry as a wolf, and it’s rather far
from—er, supplies.”
</p>
<p>
Without the slightest embarrassment, he sat
down in the group of boys and girls and joined
in the talk and laughter so naturally, that
presently they quite forgot he was a stranger
at all.
</p>
<p>
He had a talent, this ingratiating individual,
of making all of them talk a great deal, while
he listened always with that amused, quizzical
expression which Nancy confided to Elinor’s private
ear “was fascinating.” He ate a great deal
and enjoyed himself thoroughly. The sizzling,
delicious combination of beefsteak and other
things, he pronounced the most appetizing dish
he had tasted in years. He smacked his lips over
Elinor’s tea and asked for a second cup. He
joked with Nancy, smiled gravely into Mary’s
serious dark eyes, took many long searching
glances at Billie when she wasn’t looking, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_279'></a>279</span>
started each boy, even silent Charlie, on his favorite
hobby.
</p>
<p>
Before that famous luncheon was over, it really
seemed that they were entertaining an angel unawares.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_280'></a>280</span><a name='chXXII' id='chXXII'></a>CHAPTER XXII.—THE LAST OF THE HOUSE OF TROUBLES.</h2>
<p>
At last, as the afternoon shadows began to
lengthen, everybody lent a hand at clearing up
the lunch things, while the stranger in the khaki
trousers sat under a tree smoking a short black
pipe, and watched them thoughtfully.
</p>
<p>
“I smell burning,” announced Charlie, suddenly,
sniffing the air like a hunting dog.
</p>
<p>
“It’s your own fire, midget,” replied Percy.
</p>
<p>
“No, no, it’s on the breeze. There, look at
that.”
</p>
<p>
As he spoke a spark fell at his feet, then another
and another.
</p>
<p>
The stranger jumped up quickly, wet his finger
and held it in the air.
</p>
<p>
“The wind’s from the northwest,” he exclaimed
under his breath.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_281'></a>281</span>
</p>
<p>
As he faced the wind, another group of sparks,
borne on the breeze, blew against him.
</p>
<p>
“By Jove,” he cried. “It must be Virginia’s
house. Thanks for your hospitality, I must go,”
he added, starting to run down the trail.
</p>
<p>
“Come back,” called Billie, “we’ll take you in
the car quicker than you can cut through the
woods.”
</p>
<p>
Without a word the stranger turned and joined
them as they gathered their belongings together
and raced through the woods to the Comet.
</p>
<p>
Silently they piled themselves into the machine
and in another ten minutes Billie had guided
them safely over the rutty wagon track to the
hard beaten automobile road and they were speeding
along toward Virginia’s.
</p>
<p>
As they tore up the avenue of giant trees, over
which hung a cloud of dense smoke, Billie said
to the stranger who was sitting beside her:
</p>
<p>
“I know that you are Mr. Ignatius Donahue.
I have known it from the first.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_282'></a>282</span>
</p>
<p>
“How did you recognize me?” he asked smiling.
</p>
<p>
“From your pictures.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, keep the secret awhile longer,” he said.
“I have been getting over an—er—accident I was
in not long ago, and staying here quietly with
Virginia and Edward.”
</p>
<p>
The only living soul they could see as they approached
Virginia’s home was old Mammy who
was running up and down the front gallery like
a distracted creature, lifting up her voice in wails
and lamentations. One wing of the house had
entirely burned down and the flames had leapt
over the main roof and were making rapid headway.
</p>
<p>
“Bress de Lord, oh my soul,” she cried when
she saw the automobile full of people come up
to the front door.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Donahue was the first to jump out.
</p>
<p>
“Is your mistress in her room, Mammy?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, Marsa, yes, sir. I cyan’t move her a
step,” wailed the poor old woman.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_283'></a>283</span>
</p>
<p>
“Where’s Miss Virginia?”
</p>
<p>
“A lady don’ sen’ fur her to come to the hotel
quick. She’s been gone an hour.”
</p>
<p>
“Where’s Uncle Peter?”
</p>
<p>
“He don’ drive little Missy over, Marsa.”
</p>
<p>
Another moment, and Mr. Donahue had disappeared
in the smoke-filled house, followed by
the boys.
</p>
<p>
Then Billie did something for which I am sure
you will hardly know whether to commend her
for her bravery or blame her for her recklessness.
</p>
<p>
“Where’s Dick, the mocking bird, Mammy?”
she asked.
</p>
<p>
“In his cage in de kitchen, little Missy,”
moaned the colored woman, rocking herself back
and forth.
</p>
<p>
Running around the back of the house where
she dimly remembered the kitchen was situated,
Billie pressed her face against one of the windows
and peered into the room, which was fast
filling with smoke that poured in from a passage
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_284'></a>284</span>
leading from the burning wing. She knew it
was the kitchen because the floor was of brick
and she could make out the dim outline of the
great range which had not been used in all these
years. It was impossible to find the door in all
the intricate back region of the old house. It
must be somewhere in that smoke-filled passage.
Seizing an old stool under the window, Billie
broke in the glass; then using it to stand on, she
climbed through.
</p>
<p>
“Dick, old fellow,” she called.
</p>
<p>
A feeble chirp answered. Yes, there he was,
huddled in his cage, his feathers all ruffled up
and his head under his wing. She seized the
cage and ran to the window just as the roof of
the wing with a great crash fell in, covering the
porch outside with burning debris. A volume of
smoke and flame outside curled into the open window
and she knew that escape was impossible
that way.
</p>
<p>
As she ran up the three steps which divided
the kitchen from the next room, she stumbled and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_285'></a>285</span>
fell over something stretched across the doorway.
It was the body of a man lying face downward,
his head on his arm. Seizing him by the
shoulders, she dragged him away from the door
and closed it to keep the smoke from pouring
in. Then to confirm the suspicions which had
come to her when she saw the rumpled black
hair and slight, well-knit frame, she turned the
man over.
</p>
<p>
“Edward!” she cried. “Get in here, Dicky-bird,”
she said, slipping the mocking bird from
the cage into her blouse.
</p>
<p>
Seizing the unconscious boy by his ankles, she
began dragging him slowly across the floor. It
required all her strength, but she managed to
get him through the doorway and into the hall.
The smoke was terrible, however. Not in the
great fire at Shell Island had it seemed so dense
and thick. At last, staggering toward the door,
she called:
</p>
<p>
“Help! Help!”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_286'></a>286</span>
</p>
<p>
It was Ignatius Donahue who carried her out
in his arms, while she whispered hoarsely,
</p>
<p>
“Be careful not to crush the bird! He’s in my
blouse.”
</p>
<p>
Edward’s double and Charlie Clay lifted him
out of the smoke-filled hall.
</p>
<p>
“Shan’t we try and save the house, sir?” asked
Percy, who saw in the stranger now only a very
distinguished person, born to command.
</p>
<p>
“No, no, my boy. It can’t be saved and it had
better burn. It has been a house of sorrow
always.”
</p>
<p>
They carried Edward l’Estrange farther down
the avenue to the automobile which had been
moved out of reach of smoke and sparks. As
Billie’s dazed senses began to return, she saw,
sitting in the back, Virginia’s mother, very pale
and ill. But strange to say, the invalid was not
looking at the house. Her eyes were fastened
on Ignatius Donahue with an expression in which
could be read many things: wonder, surprise,
perhaps even joy. Billie thought her more beautiful
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_287'></a>287</span>
even than the first time she had met her,
and it occurred to her, watching the delicate,
lovely face, that at least the poor lady would
never know now about her prized heirlooms.
They would to her always have been burned with
the house.
</p>
<p>
Edward l’Estrange was not long unconscious,
after he was brought into the fresh air. They
chafed his wrists and temples and presently he
opened his eyes.
</p>
<p>
“Are they all safe?” he asked as memory returned
to him.
</p>
<p>
“All safe, my boy, and if you are able to stand
up, we’d better be taking your mother back to
the hotel,” answered Mr. Donahue.
</p>
<p>
As he spoke, the roof of the old house crashed
in and the four walls stood out bleak and desolate
in the smoking ruins.
</p>
<p>
The Comet carried a big load that afternoon.
For the first time in her life, old Mammy rode
in an automobile, but the old woman, like her
mistress, was too dazed to realize that she was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_288'></a>288</span>
skimming along the high road at the rate of
thirty miles an hour.
</p>
<p>
On the way to the hotel, Billie heard Mr. Donahue
say to Edward: “I didn’t know you were
in the house or in the neighborhood, my boy.”
</p>
<p>
“I only arrived this morning. I was to stay
away two or three days longer, but I went to
your office in New York as you directed, with
the message for your secretary, and while I
was waiting a bunch of mail arrived. The letter
on top was this. It may have been wrong,
but I took it because you see I couldn’t help recognizing
the handwriting as my father’s. Who
directed it or where it came from, is a mystery.”
</p>
<p>
He put his hand in his pocket and drew out a
letter which Billie recognized as the very one
she had re-directed several days before.
</p>
<p>
“But where did it come from?” demanded Mr.
Donahue in amazement.
</p>
<p>
“We found it under a little house in the
woods,” she broke in, “and I sent it to your New
York address, which is the one Papa gave me.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_289'></a>289</span>
</p>
<p>
“You are a jolly, clever young lady,” cried the
older man delightedly, “and you can never know
what a debt of gratitude we owe you.”
</p>
<p>
It was a lucky chance that Mr. Duffy’s motor
car happened to pass before they reached the
hotel, and some of the party were transferred
to that roomy and capacious machine. So that
the overloaded Comet did not, after all, create a
sensation as it rolled up to the side entrance of
the hotel.
</p>
<p>
Contrary to their expectations, Mrs. l’Estrange
was neither ill nor cast down. Perhaps she did
not realize yet that her home had just been burned
to the ground. At any rate, when Mr. Donahue
carried her into the hotel, she rested her cheek
on his shoulder and said softly:
</p>
<p>
“You find me a broken old woman, Ignatius.”
</p>
<p>
“No, no, Virginia. Only much paler and thinner.
There is a great doctor who is an intimate
friend of mine, and he has promised to come
down in a few days and have a look at that spine
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_290'></a>290</span>
of yours. I have enormous faith in him. I believe
he can cure you.”
</p>
<p>
The two Edwards were talking earnestly together
when Billie restored the little mocking
bird to its master, and before they parted they
grasped hands like two brothers who had been
reunited after a long separation.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_291'></a>291</span><a name='chXXIII' id='chXXIII'></a>CHAPTER XXIII.—EXPLANATIONS.</h2>
<p>
Late that evening, when Billie sat resting on
the piazza, not caring to join the others who were
laughing and talking together, Edward l’Estrange
drew up a chair beside her and told her
the strange story which had drawn them all into
a network of puzzling incidents.
</p>
<p>
“My father was an Englishman, Billie. His
name was Paxton.”
</p>
<p>
Billie started.
</p>
<p>
“Then you are——”
</p>
<p>
“Yes. I am Edward’s first cousin. Our fathers
were twins and adored each other as twins
usually do. My father did not get on well with
his mother because he wanted to be a musician.
Edward’s father was more practical and he was
her favorite son. But he was dissipated, and
once in a fit of wild temper he committed a crime,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_292'></a>292</span>
and when they arrested my father by mistake,
his brother let him go to jail.”
</p>
<p>
“How dreadful! How wicked!” put in Billie.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, it was pretty bad. But Edward’s father
made up for it afterwards by his misfortunes,
and at last he committed suicide. But to go on,
my father escaped and came to this country. He
changed his name and went south where he met
my mother and eloped with her, although she was
to have been married the next day to Ignatius
Donahue. It was wrong, of course, and I can’t
defend it except that they were so much in love.
They lived very happily until my father got word
that they were on the track of him. My mother
wanted him to fight it out in the courts, but it
would have been a difficult case, because you see
he had run away. My father was very delicate
and visionary, and I suppose he lacked the spirit
to defend himself. At any rate, he would build
the house in the pine woods and hide himself,
and there he stayed for several months—until we
brought him home to die, in fact. Just before
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_293'></a>293</span>
the end came, he called me into his room one day
and told me that he had in his possession a very
valuable letter. He had addressed it to Mr.
Donahue but it was not to be delivered unless
we were in actual want. As we had plenty of
money, it didn’t seem likely then that the letter
would ever be sent. Anyhow, when I went to
look for it, I couldn’t find it. My father’s mind
must have been wandering at the time.
</p>
<p>
“But that wasn’t the end of our troubles, because
after father’s death, mother had a fall and
injured her spine so that she has never been able
to walk a step since. Then the cotton mills, in
which all her money was invested, failed and we
lost every cent we had. Mother doesn’t know
that, though. Virginia and I have managed to
keep it from her, so far.”
</p>
<p>
“I know,” said Billie. “You were wonderful,
both of you. But what was in the letter?”
</p>
<p>
“It came just before father’s death, while he
was still at the little house, and it was a full confession
written by his brother. After we got
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_294'></a>294</span>
so poor, I wrote to Mr. Donahue, thinking perhaps
he might have received this lost letter. I
suppose father wanted him to have it because
of his devotion to mother, and he has helped us
in every sort of way. I think he bought the Firefly
just for me to take parties out in. He never
came to our house, but he used to run down
here on his car for a night or two and consult
with me.”
</p>
<p>
“One more question?” asked Billie. “What
was he doing that night in the avenue when he
had the fight with the man in the motor car?”
</p>
<p>
“Well,” said Edward, “you must know that
there were people who were trying to get that
paper away from us before my grandmother
could see it. Clarence’s people they were, a bad
lot. I suppose they thought if Clarence inherited
his grandmother’s millions, they would all come
in for their share.
</p>
<p>
“That fellow who fought with Mr. Donahue
represented himself as coming from my grandmother.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_295'></a>295</span>
But then he tried to play a double game
and Mr. Donahue caught on and they fought.”
</p>
<p>
“Now, a last question, Edward. Where in the
world have you been hiding?”
</p>
<p>
“You see, my grandmother and I made friends
immediately. When I took the stick away from
her that day, she saw at once I was not Edward
Paxton, although that is really my name, and
she knew she had found her other grandson.
The quarrel we had when I broke her stick later
in St. Augustine was all fixed up between us.
She enjoyed it immensely. Then she ordered
me to lie low somewhere, until she sent for me.
She was anxious to see if Edward would really
keep his word and get to work. He has, so I
suppose she’s well pleased. But she has had a
hard life. Her children disappointed her one way
or another, and have all died, and her grandchildren
didn’t seem to come up to the mark either.
She’s just a soured, embittered old woman, but
I like her, anyhow, now that we understand each
other.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_296'></a>296</span>
</p>
<p>
That night Billie related the strange story to
her three intimate friends in their bedroom.
Each Motor Maid made her own characteristic
observation.
</p>
<p>
Nancy, standing before the mirror, rolling her
curls on her pretty fingers, smiled at her image
and remarked:
</p>
<p>
“Mr. Ignatius Donahue is the most charming,
fascinating, delightful man I ever met.”
</p>
<p>
Elinor, in a long white bath robe, her braids
twisted around her small head like a coronet, observed:
</p>
<p>
“It was really family pride, I suppose, that
made Edward l’Estrange’s father keep the letter
a secret.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, no, Elinor,” cried Mary, seated cross-legged
on the bed, while she thoughtfully
brushed her fine brown hair, “it was his love for
his brother. They say that the love of one twin
for another passeth understanding.”
</p>
<p>
“Whatever it was,” said Billie, lying flat on
her back on the bed and gazing up at the ceiling,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_297'></a>297</span>
“a fine American boy and girl, honest and plucky
and proud, too, for that matter, have come up,
head and shoulders from the whole wretched
muddle.”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_298'></a>298</span><a name='chXXIV' id='chXXIV'></a>CHAPTER XXIV.—SO ENDETH THE SECOND LESSON.</h2>
<p>
“Sit right there in a row in front of me, so
that I may have a good look at you, young ladies.
Now, tell me all of your names. This one I
know: Mistress Elinor Butler, an American
Princess. Wilhelmina Campbell? Ah, you are
the brave young woman who saves people’s lives,
Anne Starbuck Brown? You’re Irish, my dear,
I can tell by your blue eyes and your pretty, impudent
face. Mary Anastasia Price? Those
eyes of yours, my child, are too earnest and serious
for this wicked world.”
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Paxton-Steele had left her room this
morning for the first time since the explosion, and
the two Edwards, her grandsons, as like as two
peas in a pod, had pushed her rolling chair down
to the beach. Then she had sent her man servant
scurrying back to the hotel with her compliments
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_299'></a>299</span>
to the Motor Maids—and would they do her the
pleasure of calling on her that morning on the
sands?
</p>
<p>
Her tongue was still quite thick and her head
shook a little as she spoke, but the old eagle sat
as erect as ever, the brim of her garden hat
flapping up and down in the breeze as it always
had.
</p>
<p>
The girls felt sorry for the aged woman
whose early life had been filled with sorrows and
disappointments and her last years poisoned by
scheming relatives who desired her money.
</p>
<p>
“So these are the Motor Maids,” went on Mrs.
Paxton-Steele. “Do you know, my dears, why
I asked you to spend one of your golden hours
with a stricken old woman like me? It is because
I want to thank you. You have taught me the
second great lesson of my life. The first one I
learned when I was a young woman. The second
one now comes to me on the brink of the
grave.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_300'></a>300</span>
</p>
<p>
“A vain, cruel, stupid bully! A selfish old
woman, eh?”
</p>
<p>
Elinor flushed. How disrespectful those words
seemed to her now!
</p>
<p>
But the old eagle chuckled to herself.
</p>
<p>
“I have certainly been all those things,” she
continued, “and I want to thank you, Mistress
Elinor, for speaking out your mind. You might
have added blind, too. I have been blind—blind.
</p>
<p>
“My poor boys who have been dead so long,
have been restored to me in their own sons, and
I am very happy.”
</p>
<p>
Here she paused and closed her eyes to hide
the tears which had welled into them.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, I am happy,” she went on. “They are
fine boys, both of them. And all of this I owe
to the Motor Maids. You have done what I
could not do. You have righted a great wrong
and reunited a broken, scattered family.
</p>
<p>
“I am glad—yes, proud, that my new grandchildren
are half American. And now give me
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_301'></a>301</span>
your hand, each one of you, and run along and
play. I am old and tired, but, thank God, I am
still alive and able to enjoy this last blessing of
my life.”
</p>
<p>
One by one the four girls bowed their heads
over the hand of the broken old eagle, pretending
not to notice the two tears which trickled
down her furrowed cheeks.
</p>
<p>
They smiled at the two Edwards, who stood
like sentinels at the side of her chair, waved a
gay salutation to Virginia and Georgiana coming
toward them arm in arm, and all but collided
with Mr. Ignatius Donahue following behind at
a slower pace.
</p>
<p>
“Where are you running away to, my pretty
maids?” he cried, spreading out his arms playfully
to block their passage.
</p>
<p>
“This is our last day at Palm Beach, you
know,” answered Billie. “We leave for home to-night,
and we are going to ride out in the Comet
to say good-bye to the Duffys.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_302'></a>302</span>
</p>
<p>
“And we are to have no more jolly picnics?”
he asked.
</p>
<p>
“Not unless you come to West Haven, Mr.
Donahue, and let us take you on a Comet picnic
to Seven League Island.”
</p>
<p>
Mr. Donahue looked at them with that humorous,
quizzical expression that they remembered
to have noticed in his photograph.
</p>
<p>
“I’m going to have a picnic party myself in a
few months,” he said, “and if that picnic comes
off, you may see a private car backed upon a side
track in West Haven, and you will know, if you
do, that at the happiest period of my life I have
come to spend a day with the four nice girls who
helped to bring it about.”
</p>
<p>
“Why, what does he mean?” asked Elinor, as
they hurried on to the hotel.
</p>
<p>
“I think he means he is going to marry Mrs.
l’Estrange,” answered Billie. “He has brought
a big osteopath down here to see her and something’s
being put to rights in her spine. She’s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_303'></a>303</span>
expected to get perfectly well, Virginia told
me.”
</p>
<p>
“But how did we bring anything about?”
</p>
<p>
“I can’t say, unless it was the Comet, bless
him, that got us to the burning house in time to
save her life.”
</p>
<p>
The red car was waiting for them when they
reached the hotel, and Miss Campbell, also, on
the piazza, her peach-blossom face framed in the
familiar motor veil of sky blue.
</p>
<p>
Presently they rolled swiftly away toward the
home of their good friends, the Duffys, and in
the memories of all who saw them start on that
bright morning, there was left no happier impression
of Florida’s holiday glory than the light
in the faces of the four Motor Maids.
</p>
<p>
If the girls themselves could have seen, stretching
far into the future, the road of experience
and adventure over which the Comet was to take
them, their faces would have been aglow with
anticipation as well as with present pleasure.
For the way that they were next to travel is one
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_304'></a>304</span>
that each and all should know, and even if you
can go in no other party, we are sure that you
will enjoy following “The Motor Maids Across
the Continent,” in the story of their next trip.

<p>Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/license">http://www.gutenberg.org/license)</a>.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
